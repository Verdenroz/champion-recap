As you wish.
Silence!
Balance above all else.
As you wish.
Your magic is powerless against me!
Justice will be served.
You are null and void.
I tried to silence my mother once. Boy, did I regret that.
You are null and void.
As you wish.
Justice will be served.
I'm on my way.
Balance above all else.
Try that again!
The balance of power must be preserved.
