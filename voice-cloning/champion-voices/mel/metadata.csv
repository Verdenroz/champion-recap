wavs/audio_0001.wav|My countermeasures are ready. Even if you are not.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Your promises will not sway me!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|The perfect creature to test the limits of my magic!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Feel my light!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Do not test me!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Bother someone else.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You try my patience!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|A necessary maneuver.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|I cannot be undone!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Disgraceful!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|How unrefined.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I protect my own.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|So little effort.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|You're in my way!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|You seem ill-prepared.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Impress me!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Spare the pleasantries.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Trivial antics.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Still warming up?
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Stay… with me…
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Does my family… fall with me?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I did my best, Kino…
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Mother, I couldn't…
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Mind your step!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Pace yourself.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Catch this!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Mother… I'm ready to show you what I've learned.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Our alliance was fruitful,Kiramman. A pity it had to end.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|A man with an inflated ego. Groundbreaking.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Professor… is this your last act of defiance?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Such… despair. What is it that haunts you, Hwei?
wavs/audio_0032.wav|What will prevail, our affection, or our ambition?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I overlooked your mayhem once, Jinx. I will not repeat that mistake!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Let's see whose light shines brighter!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|You move through this world as I once did, Senna… as if you fear losing yourself to your past.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Tell me, Jericho Swain: is your vision as sharp as your tongue?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Vi… When you try to please everyone,no oneis satisfied.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|You claim to desire 'peace'; but it seems our definition may differ.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|What is it that you hope to accomplish?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I suggest you reconsider! There's no reason for you to suffer.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Willing to risk your life for this endeavor?
wavs/audio_0042.wav|My presencealoneis your final warning.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|It's not too late for you to turn back!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Something tells me you're not interested in a peaceful resolution.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|She's beauty and she's grace, she's…OH!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Empty platitudes provide little comfort.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You arenoMedarda.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You taught me well, mother: a wolf has no mercy.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Draven, such bravado! And such… fragility.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Welcome to war.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|From one artist to another: your passion outshines the pain.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Another love, torn away… Goodbye, Jayce.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Such senseless chaos, Jinx.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Tell the others I'm coming for them.Sister.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Even in defeat, your light never dimmed.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|THEY FALL BEFORE ME LIKE LONG SHADOWS CAST BY A SETTING SUN!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Senna, there is no more past; rest, now.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|General. Didn't foresee this outcome, did you?
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Was the badge worth it, Vi?
wavs/audio_0060.wav|And here I thought you were more than another man with a god complex.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|They never listen.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|An avoidable outcome. Shame.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Another malefactor subdued.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Call it 'magical intervention'.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Nothing I couldn't handle.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You were in over your head.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|This conflict was beyond your comprehension.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Well, I would have preferred a compromise…
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Thought I'd… 'lighten' the mood a little.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I never thought I'd see the day. Let us fight together, mother… as equals.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|My mother is willing to sacrifice anything,anyone. If you value your life, do not hold back.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Medardasare known for our strategy and strength. Follow my direction and we'll emerge from this victorious.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|There's no telling what fate has in store for us… All we can do is move forward.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|It seems as if my absence has left you doubting my abilities. I'll resolve that misconception.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I am no stranger to war—allow me to finish what our foes have started.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|If blood must be drawn to secure our safety, so be it.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|To think these gifts were hidden within me. The lives I could have saved…
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Everything I accomplished inPiltovermeans little in the eyes ofNoxus.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|With each obstacle I overcome, I leave behind a chasm of uncertainty.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Revenge is shortsighted; I cannot submit to its temptations.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|For so long, I wanted to regain my family's respect; but I wasn't prepare for what it would cost me…
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Lies may seed hope in the naive, but they erode the roots of those who plant them.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|The Medardas depend on my strength. My unwaivering conviction.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I feel them watching,desperatefor something that proves I'm unfit to lead. Let them waste their time!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|What else is hidden beneath my sigils…?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|To blend in, we shed authenticity.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Compassion does not beget weakness.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Leadership requires one to learn quickly and constantly.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|War should only be a last resort.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|The wolf, the fox—both necessary, both unrelenting.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Change is the only constant.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Any worthwhile venture involves risk.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Inaction invites regret.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I choose to forgive wherever possible.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|The best lies are wrapped in truth.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Assess the surroundings; anticipate any outcome!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Only trust those who've earned it.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Now that I've returned to my family, what challenges await us?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|The arcane is at my fingertips…
wavs/audio_0100.wav|TheBlack Rosewillanswer for all that they've done.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|See through deception.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Steady is stagnant.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Kino… I should've been there for you.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Any desire can be exploited.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|A true leader is secure in her judgment.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Things were so much simpler on theCouncil!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I deserve everything I've attained; I know that now.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I'll outshine them all.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|The wrath of the Medardas!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Illuminate their lies!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I kneel to no one!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Fatigue is the enemy of success.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Such negotiations are rarely linear.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Constant use of my magic is beginning to take a toll. A brief break should do the trick.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Just a moment—I require additional resources!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Rest is strategic: restoring the body and reigniting the mind.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Medardas stay ready at all times, be it with friend or foe.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|So, I've returned—yet another mystery!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Adapt to their behavior.Nomore mistakes!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|My magic still flows. Do my sigils protect it?
wavs/audio_0121.wav|No, I was born to lead; I will show them why.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|A mere oversight…!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Focus. Do not lose your composure.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|The foolish need not approach!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|My apologies—I don't recall asking for your input.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Your best was insufficient!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Was that your full strength?
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I hardly felt a thing.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|The golden rule!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Change of plans!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|A valiant attempt.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Not interested.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|My rebuttal!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Reposition!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|With grace!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|A paradigm shift!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Shatter their expectations.
