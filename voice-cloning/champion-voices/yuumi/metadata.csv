wavs/audio_0037.wav|Now you're ready to prowl!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Wow, so you're in charge of the giant litter box, huh, bird guy?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Yeah, you birds can fly! Well, so can cats! This cat.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Hey, Kog'Maw! I like coughing things up too!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|You can't have Book, large metal cat!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Book, you've got it backward. You said Nasus was a god! But he's just a dog.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|I'm gonna eat all your leaves and throw 'em up!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Oh wow, hook man! Someone who can actually fish!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Oh, so you're Xayah's pet!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Tell me, Rengar. How do you groom all that fur?
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Teemo?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Rats? I'm against them. Extremely bad.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Make your shinylight glow, Vel'Koz! I wanna chase it!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|The red... dot... belongs toyou?!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Rawr! That's how bears talk.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|My purr is louder than your growl, dog.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Here, fishy fishy fishy! Meow~
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Have you seen my master? She's about your size.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Get ready to face the mighty Yuumi! Oh, and Book.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Rawr!!! ...'Scuse me.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Fishy fishy fish! Mmph— Waagh!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I bopped them all!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|The power of friendship!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Squashed like a bug!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Oh! I thought we were playing! Are youdead?!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I did it! I knocked it over!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|We did it! We knocked 'em over!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|We're killing buddies!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Do you want me to bury that?
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Woohoo! Now I can bat around the body!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Cats make great companions! Just ask my master... who disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Alright! Which one of you's got great aim, and is good at chin scritches?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Who's ready to risk our lives, defeat our foes, and maybe knock over some cups?
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Tell me the game plan again. Wait. Fish! Someone has fish! Where is it?
wavs/audio_0071.wav|So, who wants to be my best friend? ...Book, I know you're already my best friend!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Book, sometimes I pretend you're just a nice comfy box! ...What? That's a compliment! Purr~
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I've read all of Book. Well, most of Book. I like the pictures of fish... of which there arenone, Book! Meow...
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Ah, I miss the way my yordle scratched between my ears. ...Being read from cover to cover sounds nice too.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I save my friends? No one notices. I open a teensy portal to the spirit realm? Everyone is up in my fur!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Hmm, today should I follow my head? Or my nose, or.. Oh! Sunbeam ahead! Let's chase that!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|If I didn't have to protect Book, I'd just be a normal magical cat floating aroundBandle City! Okay,nappingaround Bandle City.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Naps make my magic stronger! It's true! Look! ...I'm so strong, mmh, so strong!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|The Book-keeper is a great role for someone as responsible as me! ...What?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I'm descended from lions! And you're descended from trees! We're in our element, Book!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|If I ever lost you, Book, the fabric of the spirit realm would get all torn up! And I'd lose my best friend.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Someone scratched out the page that led here! That's right, Book. Someone! We'll never know who.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Hey Book, do you ever take a nap? ...You can't?! What do you do all day?!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I am the brains, you are the brawn, Book! ...Is Book.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Hey, new friend? Uh, warn me if you're going to do something crazy, okay?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Don't worry, I'll be here through thick or thin! Unless I smell fish. Do you have fish?!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Hey. Hey. Hey.Hey! ...Huh? Oh no, I don't need anything!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|If someone told you to jump in a lake, would you do it? Just 'cause... I go where you go.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I bet we'll be friends forever! Well, unless you wander into the brush with your face.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Don't get too attached, Book! This one looks reckless...
wavs/audio_0091.wav|In case you're wondering what that smell is, it's Book. Smells like old trees.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Do you know what   means? Book called me that and I think it might be mean.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|You hungry? I stuck a leftover rat on page 237! Meow!~
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The only thing standing between us and lunch is... our enemies.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|A river? Uh-uh! Book hates water!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Do not drop me! Do not drop me!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|♪ Where's my fishy fish fish dish? ♪ Meow!~
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Today we are destroyers!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Don't tell anyone but... I love hugs.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Where's my fishy fishy fish for my dishy dishy dish?!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Keep an eye out for red dot, Book! It's gotta be here somewhere.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The expert huntress stalks the battlefield.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Where to, Book? Purr~
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I won't lose you, Book! Not after losing master.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Book, float us that-a-way!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|If we find a rat, I call dibs! Or a bug. Or a FISH!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|This way! No THIS way! Woah-kay, that way it is.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Do you ever get so sleepy you fall asleep sitting up? Just me?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Wherever you go, I go! Just... don't go somewhere bad.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Faster! Faster!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Do you have snacks in your pocket? How 'bout now? ...How 'bout now?!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I'm like your ghost! oooOOooOOoo!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I could tell you wanted a brave and powerful warrior by your side.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Okay, it's time to prowl! You do know how to prowl, right?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Mush, mush! Wheeeeheehee!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|They aren't ready for the ferocious team of... US!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|You can pet me on my chin and back! Nowhere else. Mrow!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Is it time to save our friends again?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Ooh, you smell good! Did you recently fish?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Rubbing my head on you means you're mine! Purr~
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I have the best aim in the spirit realm!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Zoooooom!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I am the most magic!!

wavs/audio_0127.wav|This is my favorite chapter!!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Ever pretend you're part of the floor? I do.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I tried your thing, Book. Now let's try my thing: napping!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|I guess we're going this-a-way.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I'll stick with you!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Is it time to save the world again?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|It's okay, we've got 6 left... or was it 5?
wavs/audio_0134.wav|You look like unscratched furniture!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Want a book thrown at your head?! (Whispering) ...Don't worry, Book. I would never do that!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Woo! Here we goooooooo!

wavs/audio_0142.wav|Time to find a new friend!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Back on my own! Meow~
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I'm an independent cat.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|It's just you and me, Book!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I'm Yuumi, and you're warm!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|I've got a good feeling about this one, Book!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|So, you need a new shield buddy?
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Book, meet new friend!
