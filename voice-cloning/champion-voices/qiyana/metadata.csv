wavs/audio_0001.wav|You are right to fear my greatness.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Such insolence!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Look around, so many ways to kill you.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Jaw-dropping, I know.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Show some respect!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Twirl!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Go on, amuse me.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Simpleton.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|So basic.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Losing is your element.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Here! You're used to failure.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is beneath me.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I command you to die!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Qi-ya-na! Say it!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Don't walk where I walk.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|You presume too much.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|What do you think you're doing?!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Nuh-uh. You've got to go.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Avert your eyes!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Saal yun esqu'uña
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Give me praise!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Here's some advice: quit!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Don't bring that trash over here.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|I love your little weapons.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Bow your head or lose it!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You're going to die looking like that?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Why do you not grovel?
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Know your place!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You forgot to bow.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Ugh, look at you.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Waste of elements!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Nobody... touch my stuff...
wavs/audio_0033.wav|But I'm too amazing to die...
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Put a monument... here...
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Impossible...
wavs/audio_0036.wav|How... dare you!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|You only know one element? How quaint.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Commanding just one element must be quite dull. Then again, it's so you!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Estem qa'eve
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Impressive magic. Did you buy that at a discount?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Your magic is so primitive. Just like your sense of style.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Aww, your primitive magic is adorable.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|First time seeing real magic? I'll go slowly so you may follow along.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Please, lizard, you cannot copy perfection.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I have a message for you to spread to everyone in your... Pil-tover.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Magic from machines? How cheap and distasteful.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You Pilt-ovans are like flying squirrels pretending to soar like the eagles.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|I have great plans for Shurima, starting with you.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|We have the great city of Ixaocan. What does your Shurima have?  Sand and ghosts.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Why yes, I believe I will throw another rock.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|The jungle obeys me, Zyra. In time, you will do the same.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I am the shaper of lands, and who are you? A nobody.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|The rocks don't like you, the plants don't like you, and I'm pretty sure I don't like you.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|There are levels to this competition. Better stay on yours.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|How proud you are of your abilities, like an ape who just found a stick.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Why are you in my space? I cannot be seen with the likes of you.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I claim— Claim this land for Ixao— I WILL CLAIM THIS LAND FOR IXAOCAN!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Could someone dispose of these corpses?
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Failure, failure, failure, failure, failure.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|It is exhausting to crush you so much!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Rejoice! You are now part of the legend of Qiyana!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You're welcome. Next!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Not my fault. They should have bowed.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Prime Qiyana.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Recognize.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|If you bleed on me, I'll kill you again!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Ha! You even die ugly.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Who were you again?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|That's where you belong. In the dirt.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Congratulations, you have Qiyana. The other side, they have no Qiyana.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Oh, good, servants. Carry my panoply to the battle, would you?
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Cover the ground behind me. None may tread where I have stepped.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I would say 'watch and learn,' but unfortunately you cannot learn this.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Is that all they brought to face us? My omele could defeat them, and she is 85.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I'm extremely good, at everything.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I can tell by your expressions you've never met a superior being.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I know what they are thinking:
wavs/audio_0078.wav|We should throw a feast for me, but we'll need something to celebrate. I know! Let us crush the enemy!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Someday, all this will be Ixaocan. A glorious empire, with an empress to fit.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|If I command the rivers to flow backward, they shall.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I name this the River Qiyana.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The perfect place to dispose of my enemies.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Ee-shao-can! They will all learn to say it.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I'm not arrogant, I'm right.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|cao-mul
wavs/audio_0086.wav|This place will be a lovely addition to my empire.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|My feet cannot step where lesser beings have tread.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I hate it when they dare look me in the eye.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I will grant this place the privilege of being conquered by me.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|If they want to worship me... hmph, I will not stop them.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|'Empress Qiyana...' I do like the sound of that.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Being young means living to see all your enemies die first.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Some people are just born better.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Some wait their turn, and some take what they deserve.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|The secrets of my enemies carry far on the wind.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Ugh, this place could use some reshaping.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Line them up. I will bend their knees.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Things do what I tell them to. Right, rocks?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|If talent were an element, perhaps I could throw some at them.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|No more hiding in the wilderness. I demand to be seen!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|You know what's hard about being a princess? Nothing.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Hard work is for those who possess no talent.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|My parents rule with fairness and compassion. So boring.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Those who find Ixtal do not live to speak of it.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|There will always be someone who is better, and that person is me.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|It is a travesty to not be carried by servants.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I do not lack empathy. Other people just need to be better.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I cannot wait to be empress. If only my entire family were not in the way.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I wish there was someone else as perfect as me.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I'm getting hot. Where is my royal fanner?!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|
wavs/audio_0112.wav|One throne, nine sisters. Nine tragic accidents waiting to happen.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|My enemies try their best. That is what is so sad.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Of course I've mastered fire... I just don't like to show off.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Everyone, your future empress is leaving the fight. ...Okay, carry on.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Excuse me! ...Uh, excuse me?! Ugh. When I return, this place better have a statue of me.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Grass? Oh grass? Take me away from this tiresome battle. And can you also fan me?
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Servants, my palanquin. Servants? Ugh, must I do everything myself?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Can't keep me in the ground. The ground obeys me.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|See? Even death is no match for Qiyana.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I suppose they will make me do this the hard way.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Did anyone see that?  Well, I'll just have to kill them.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|That was no crushing; that was merely a squeeze.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I say give them a win. They're so cute when they think they have a chance.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|I see you have mastered the element of wind.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I can see your weakness; it is just, well, all of you.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I have humiliated my own sisters. What do you think I'll do to you?
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Oh grass, please hide me from these imbeciles.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I do look good in green.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Brings out my eyes.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|They'll never see me coming. What a shame.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|This will grow on the graves of my enemies.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|As green as the envy of my sisters.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|So many rocks, so many enemies.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Let us throw rocks at them and laugh.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Rock is so common. Just like them.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|For crushing.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Stone, the foundation of empires.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|See? The land knows it is mine.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Oh rock, smash these idiots, won't you?
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Freeze them in their place!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Wet, like the tears of my enemies.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Drown them, freeze them, watch them sink.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|That chill in the air? It's me.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|They always said I was cold.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|The best thing about water? My reflection.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|You may now appreciate me.
