wavs/audio_0001.wav|No spark between us anyway.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|A gift from Zaun.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Catch!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Heads up!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Electrocute!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Ha! Surprise!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Short on sparks.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Gotta fuel up.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Running on empty.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Come on! Charge already!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Need more power.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I'm not... done...
wavs/audio_0013.wav|No! I can fight...
wavs/audio_0014.wav|People need... me...
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Off I go.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Go time!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Bye!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|See ya!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Gotta zip!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|That's my cue!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Blitz, you used to help me climb the clock tower. That arm of yours is no joke.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|A gun and a badge don't make you a hero.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Ekko, you don't have to fight alone. Us Zaun kids, we stick together.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Ezreal, you're the type of guy that's not worth my time.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Professor, don't make me blow up your inventions again.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|"""Janna, you do exist! Your wind, my lightning. Let's make a storm!"
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Hoy, Jinx! How many rockets you making me dodge this time, huh?
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Pretty songs don't fix problems, Seraphine. Actions do.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|A real rat with a crossbow? Can't believe I owe my Dad money.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Vi, you could've fought for Zaun. But you chose not to.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Is that another me? Or someone else?
wavs/audio_0032.wav|No one's ever asked me to zap them, Ziggs. That's new.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|If I can just, uh, get this to work. Ah!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Nope. Not funny.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Quite the swing, Blitz. Let's have another go.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Well, Caitlyn. Out of touch, out of luck.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|You can do better, Ekko. Rewind and rematch.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Liked your gauntlet, Ez. Everything else? Meh.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Back to the blueprints you go!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Janna, come on! Don't let people's faith go to waste.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|That's enough animal-shaped guns for now.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Woo, that's five! We gotta celebrate!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Wow, we rock! Wait, where's the last one?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Beautiful lyrics, Sera. If only you'd backed them up.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Look at them scramble! We crushed it!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Twitch, if you want cheese-flavored trash, just ask.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Vi, I've tried punching through life. Doesn't work.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Probably a weird dream. Nothing to worry about.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Do I smell burnt squirrel?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Fried!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Ha! Got you.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Beat it!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I shoot back.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Wiped!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|You blinked!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Never count me out.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Downed one!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Too slow!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|And Dad said I was stubborn.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|You know what? We might die here. Let's make sure we go down swinging.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Yell if you need backup. I'll be there in no time.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Zaun's with me every fight. This time's no different.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Sweet, we're here. Whoa, crazy weapons! This team's great. Let's go!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Ayy, this is cool. Lotsa places to run. Charging up oughta be quick.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|No one catches me. Except for my aunt. Man, I can't get anything past her.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I stood up for my community. I can stand up for others, too.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Oh, wow. They're really out to get us. I gotta be faster.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Run fast, charge up, shoot the bad guys. Easy enough.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Grandma said: 'Never back down from a fight.' Bless that woman.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|If it matters to my team, it matters to me.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Man, I should've packed more snacks.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Gun's not broken yet. Better keep it that way.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Fight's gettin' messy. At least I'm consistent.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Never seen so little traffic. Do I miss it?
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Gotta hurry. People need my spark!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Giving up's too easy.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Do or die. I'm all in.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|This won't be perfect, but life never is.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|No slowing down.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Quick feet, quick trigger.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I don't leave others behind.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Anyone have a plan? No? No problem!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|They're like the chem-barons. Talk big, but they'll break.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Everyone's counting on me. No way I let them down.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Mistakes made are lessons learned.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Best thing I can do is fight when others can't.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I faced worse in Zaun. We can win.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Ah, fresh air. A rare treat.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Lightning in a gun coming through.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Fully charged.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Sparks ready!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Amped up!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Not a chance.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Outta my way!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|No you don't.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Unload.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|It's up to me.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I'm here!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Drop!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|You got nothin'.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Electric.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Quick, quick!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Step up!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Pst, get out!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Nuh-uh.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|In a hurry.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Don't you dare.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Shock 'em!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Count on me!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Burst fire!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I'm not messin' around.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Dodge this.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Hoy, move.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Buzz off!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|What's up?
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Incoming!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Let her rip!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Go, go, go!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Static blitz!

wavs/audio_0121.wav|Bolt 'n' jolt!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|All in!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|No holding back!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Ready to shock!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Hoy! Hear that buzz?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Lightning crash!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I am lightning!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I am lightning!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Wow. Intense.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Aww, Over already?
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Whew! Gotta recharge.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|One sec! Gun could use a little tinkering.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Hold up! There's a gear in the shop with my name on it.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Wait! I forgot something! Just stay alive, okay?
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I owe ya one!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Appreciate it!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Thanks!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Come on, Zeri. Fight to winâ€”remember that.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Ugh, might've rushed that one. It's okay, I'll do better.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Snap out of it. I can do this.Wecan do this.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|If the chem-barons couldn't keep me down, no one can.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|You wanna mess with us? Deal with me, first.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|That's a lotta talk. Let's see if you can back it up.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Boom!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Let it fly!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Ultrashock laser!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Aim and fire!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Here it comes!
