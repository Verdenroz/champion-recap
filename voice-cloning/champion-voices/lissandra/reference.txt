Foolish child.
Succumb. It's inevitable.
Embrace the cold.
Your time has passed.
Your death serves greater purpose.
I amIceborn.
Feel the power ofTrue Ice!
Foolish child.
You can't stop an avalanche.
The cold will numb your pain.
Another frozen corpse.
Flesh freezes so easily.
I've killed so many queens I've lost count!
Youreallypicked the wrong side.
Kneel before me and I will unleash your power!
I consider 'frigid'… a compliment.
I make cold look… hot.
No one will remember them.
There will be no thaw.
I see things clearly.
They cannot fight the cold.
I never rest.
All will kneel… in time.
This is but a battle. I've already won the war.
I never rest.
TheWatcherswill return.
Battles come and go. I am eternal.
This world has forgotten true power.
So many secrets, buried in ice.
I will restoreFreljord'sgreatness.
Entomb!
Freeze!
Kneel!
The world began in ice, and it will end in ice.
Surrender. My triumph is inevitable!
Close your eyes and let the cold take you.
I've been killing your kind for centuries!
At last, our ascension is at hand!
The Iceborn rule Freljord!
I will bury the world in ice.
