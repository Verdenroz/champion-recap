That just goes to show you you're nothin' but a Whiskey Delta!
It's a Charlie Foxtrot!
Consider yourself spanked, nugget!
I got a bogey on my tail!
Delta Sierra at 12 o'clock!
Lima Oscar Lima!
Zoooom...!
Another fine sortie!
Speed of heat!
I'm on it, blackshoe!
That just goes to show you you're nothin' but a Whiskey Delta!
I'm up to snuff, and gots me an ace machine!
