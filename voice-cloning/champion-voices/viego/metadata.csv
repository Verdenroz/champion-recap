wavs/audio_0001.wav|My heart was already broken.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Fall beneath my blade!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Deny me no longer!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Why do you fight?!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I am inevitable.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Ruin to all!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|All shall know my pain.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Stand aside, churl!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|This is my decree!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|The mist beckons!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I will break your heart.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|You face the ruined king.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Be one with the mist.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Serve me in death.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I must have her back!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Peasant!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Bring her back!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Return her to me!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|You dare face a king?!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Love is my weapon!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|She would want this!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You would stop me?
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Tell me where she is!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Be brought to ruin.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|My love! My love!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Where is she?!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You stole her from me!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Die for her!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Anything for her.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Lowborn filth.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|The mist devours all!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Isolde... why?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|My heart beckons!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Grant me passage!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Flow from me!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Spill forth!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Find her!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Forward, mist!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Consume everything!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Ur-demon. When all life ends, you will return to your slumber.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|For all your ambition, Hecarim, this is what you are reduced to.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Your god could not stop me before, sea priestess. Do not challenge me again.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|You will never have your vengeance, Kalista. Never.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Sing, Karthus. Sing of all that must be lost and she who must be found.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Answer for your crimes, death. Answer me.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Go on then, tree. Defeat me if you can. It will never restore the isles.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Awake, O lord, wouldsâ€™t thou reject us forever? Why do you hide your face and forget us?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Your treachery does not surprise me, Thresh. Only that you believed you'd win.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Hello, uncle. I'm surprised you haven't been torn apart by an angry mob.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Ah, the monk from the waters. And... someone else. Isolde?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Humor was better a thousand years ago.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Sorry, went down the wrong pipe.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Mist, get out of my lungs, I command you.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I demand this!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Give me your heart!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|No power in this world can stop me!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You will serve!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Kill them! Kill them all!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|This body is mine!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Surrender yourself!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Now, do as I say! Forward!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|This body, is this what you desire?!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|In death as in life, Hecarim. You will fight only for me.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|You never believed in my rule, Kalista, and now, this is your fate.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Arise, death, and greet the king who conquered you back!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|All this carnage. Do you see?! I do it for you!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Isolde... I could not see myself in your eyes.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|You are simply the latest to defy me, jailer.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|So angry, uncle. It was one unanswered letter a thousand years ago.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Isolde! I know it is you! Show yourself to me!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Your pain is nothing compared to mine.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|The dead will not rest until I am whole once more.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Every living thing is my subject!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Love is cruel. Yet, it will conquer.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I will find my love again. You matter so little.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|The weight of this moment is so much more than you.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|This flesh will do.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|You are not the hero of this tale. You are not anything.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Take me to her! Now!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|She waits for me beyond the mist. My queen. My love. My black and broken heart.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|No price is too great. No atrocity beyond my reach. For her,I will do anything.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Submission or death for all who live. In the end, it matters not. I will see her face again.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Isolde was my life. Viego died when she did and the ruined king was born.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The black mist flows from me like a tide. At times, it ebbs, but now we surge forward.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I remember her sinking beneath the waters... and then... and then...
wavs/audio_0086.wav|A world that would rob me of beauty is a world that deserves destruction.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Hate me if you must. Until she returns to my arms, all will be brought to ruin.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I will rip her from the jaws of death. Fate cannot stop me. Nothing can.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|A crown lost long ago, reborn in unlife, ripped away from his only love.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|It hurts, my heart. It hurts so much.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I want precious little, yet I am forced to kill for it.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I will take, and take, until there is nothing left but her.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The Shadow Isles are just the beginning.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The mist is my great unending sadness.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Her eyes were portraits of a world without my cruelty.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|What is lost is never lost to me.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|This mist has but one cure... and I will find her.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|And so it was that love was the gravest sin of all.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|It is such a small and fragile thing, love.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|There is no salvation from the dark, for the dark is me.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Isolde is gone. Yet I remain.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Soon, this long cruel night will end. But not yet.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I am already a monster suited for the horrors I must inflict.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|The world denied my happiness. Now, all will die.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|My forces scour the world. Nothing will escape.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|We were beautiful once.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|The curve of her lips, the softness of her smile.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|She was the star that lit my path. Without her... darkness.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|What is a wraith but the ravenous shadow of a man?
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Stand against me. Call me villain. Die.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I feel her calling out 'Viego, save me!'
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Surrender to me!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I take what is mine!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Isolde!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Where is she?!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|She will reign again at my side, and I shall be ruined no more.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|The mist will consume all. My victory is simply a matter of time.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I cast myself upon this broken throne awaiting her return.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The ruination cannot end. Not yet.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|No. She remains in this world. I can feel it.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|In a world without love, death means nothing.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I cannot hear you over the tremble in your voice.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|You stand in the way of my love. A mistake.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Step aside, peasant. You are nothing compared to my queen.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Love ruins all.
