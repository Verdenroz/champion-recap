wavs/audio_0001.wav|Fine. I don't need more enemies.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Got a whole lotta 'ugly' in my sights.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|I feel every shot.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Don't stand where the gun's pointing.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Death is always in range.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I can do 'the hard way'.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Not my funeral! Already happened.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Don't go quietly.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Darkness and light.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Keep it simple.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|All this pain... it's not mine.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|The gun doesn't have a trigger—I do.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Kill 'em twice, just to be sure.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Wanna kill me? Get in line!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Stone channels soul.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Keep your distance!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|That's enough.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|If you're here for them, you're here for me.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Die again? I'll pass.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I prefer people at gun's length.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Line up a shot while the whole world screams.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I've got your curse.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I don't miss. It's not an option.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Let's establish some boundaries.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Light becomes hope.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I fire my words, like gunlight.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You are mourned.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Rest now.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Be free.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Let go.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Out of the storm.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Pain doesn't own you.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I can bear it.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|It's not your fault.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Death is drawn to life.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Lucian!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Shadows catch the fallen...
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Together...
wavs/audio_0039.wav|One last breath...
wavs/audio_0040.wav|My enemies... Myself...
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Death remembers...
wavs/audio_0042.wav|When the mist came to my island, Demacia's gates were closed. Will they be open when you need help?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Eternal beauty, Elise? Now that's a curse!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Another nightmare? Fine. I could use the target practice while I sleep.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Horsey! What? I can like horses. I can like... things.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Running shouldn't be part of your plan, Kai'Sa. Survive the fight, not the fear.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Only a man stubborn enough to fight me would be stubborn enough to love me.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You saved me, Lucian. We saved each other.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Lucian has a way of breaking down my walls.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|In darkness, we find ourselves.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|When we run to the light, shadows are cast behind us. You need to be ready, Lux.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I know where the ruination began. It flows through us both.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|All this time, Morgana, and you still haven't learned to let go.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|'Darkness'? Welcome to my world.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I could free you, but those you've made suffer come first.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Have I suffered enough yet, or do you need me to be a corpse?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Hi, it's me. The one you've been ruthlessly hunting her whole damn life.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I know the most ancient, holy ways to kick you in the darkness.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Left one alive. Bad habit.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|When I hear chains, I reach for my gun... Wasn't wrong.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|At the center of your lantern there's a soul, wretched and afraid. I think it's you.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You don't own me, Thresh! I'm not afraid of you.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Lucian may think you're the enemy. But to me, Thresh? You're only in the way.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|You wanna get my soul? You go through the mist.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Vayne, you can aim for my heart when you find your own.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I know where the ruination began. It flows through us both.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Cats deserve love! Even if they don't need it... and they use a book to hit you in the face.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Only thing bigger than this gun? The mistake you made standing in its sights.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|If you've got a problem with me, make it two. One for each barrel.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Don't make this personal. I'm not nice.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Sothisis the terror that waddles in the night? ...Huh.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|That which does not kill us makes us stronger
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Lucian... we'll be together again soon.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|We've been through so much, Lucian... Please, don't give up on me now.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I won't stop until the nightmares have nightmares.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Handled.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Will take more than one wraith to ruinmyday.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Boo.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|He probably liked that. (Scoffs) Creep.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|In death, we fight the same fight.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|For the living. For the dead.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Every death is a sacrifice...
wavs/audio_0083.wav|If you're only dead, count yourself lucky!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I've seen too much of this—but I won't close my eyes.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Darkness to darkness. Light to light.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|So how's this gonna work?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Try to keep up.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|You ready?
wavs/audio_0089.wav|You're quiet.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|If I can handle this gun, I can handle myself. Trust me, I can handle this gun.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|The Mist
wavs/audio_0092.wav|When there's no more light, I'll carry their darkness.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Any volunteers to charge blindly into a storm of souls?
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I'm not running from them anymore. They're running from me.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Come back to life... save the world... all with weapons locked. Thesentinelstrained me right.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Where I'm going, you don't want to go. Seriously—you don't.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|The grave is silent. You're buried in all the things you never said.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I see myself in them—in the eyes of the people I save, and the darkness reflected there.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|My walls aren't unbreakable... I'm not either.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Too hard, too hurt, too changed... If you're not too much of 'something' then you're not enoughyou.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Sentinel. Wife. A beacon unto damn darkness. When can I just be a person? When can I be me?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|No one said this would be easy. If they did, they're probably dead by now.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I'm a long way from the island, but I swear there's still salt in my hair. Might just be dirt from the grave.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|The Mist
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Love was left, when everything else was torn away.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The more blood on your hands, the harder it is to let go.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|It's enough to hear Lucian say my name.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Part of me keeps wondering when I'll run into thelantern'swalls.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I used to tell myself I was fighting back... but I was only running, with a gun in my hand.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I'll get us through this.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|The gun's not heavy after all the fear I've been carrying.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|My blood still flows, but I'll never be the same.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Out of the lantern... hell came with me.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|If life is my curse, living is the cure.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|It's just nice not to be in catacombs.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I remember my nightmares. Wish I could remember to dream.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Light should teach us not to fear the dark.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The past is a wave. Keeps returning.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|It's always dark on the horizon, if you only look up during storms.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Fear moves like a current.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I forgive. No one else has to.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|That monster wants to hear me scream... He can keep waiting.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Death doesn't leave scars.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Lucian thought I was lost... but I was only changed.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Small talk wasn't really part of my training.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Hunted by the forces of darkness? Okay. I can make this work.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I don't carrythis, to compromise.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Fall behind? Follow the screams.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Those trapped in darkness need light the most.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Living my best life! ...My best second life.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|The only way out of the mist, is through it.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|The screams of the wraiths are so loud you can't hear your own.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I'm here to save them all... living and dead.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|If somethingwasn'ttrying to kill me, it would have me worried.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|It's harder to hold a hand than hold a gun.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|By the time I'm done here, dying will be the easy part.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|The mist is not my enemy.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I need you alive to kiss me.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Life from death.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|No shadow without light!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I've got you!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|No death without life!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I remember my lessons, and the people who taught them.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|The last blessings of theIsles.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Bound to the stones, bound to each other.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Each stone, a sentinel.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Life won't let me go...
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Every day I fought for my life. Why should today be any different?
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Died again? Must be getting good at it.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Death? Yeah, we're acquainted.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|To be reborn... am I still me?
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Everything that's happened... I just want it to matter.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Am I supposed to say something clever? Some of us have work to do.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|First rule of being a sentinel.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Second rule of being a sentinel. Any questions?
wavs/audio_0156.wav|No. We do this together.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|I was aiming at them!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Same as the old memories.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|And all lost in darkness.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|You're sweet!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|A nightmare. Lotta darkness. Food was great though.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|No!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Keep that up, and I'll curse you.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Worked so far.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Yeah, I met someone in there. He's a ghoul. We fell in love, and made ghoul babies...
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Not if you know what you're doing.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|I can turn into a screaming cloud.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|-for a reckoning.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|No one fights alone in the Mist.
