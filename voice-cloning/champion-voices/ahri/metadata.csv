wavs/audio_0001.wav|You don't have to be afraid of me.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Unleashed, but in control!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|I'm famished.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Shall we?
wavs/audio_0005.wav|You're my prey now.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I see all that you are.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Don't tempt me.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Just a taste.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|The hunter and the hunted.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|This flavor...
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Eyes on me.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Don't be afraid.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I don't play with my food.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|My true nature.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I see right through you.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|I cannot be tamed!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I am the wild.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|You think you can win?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Self-hatred? Far from it.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Tell me a secret.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Remember this.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|My ancestors die with me...
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Maybe I'll see him again...
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Will I also be forgotten...?
wavs/audio_0025.wav|You're mine now.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Give me your heart!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I don't bite... much.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Got you!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You're safe with me.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Come here often?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Mwah!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Come closer!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Oh, don't go.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Braum, your heart is like a warm blanket in a winter storm.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Our destiny still awaits us, Illaoi.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|I am no longer lost, Lillia. Nor do I still want to forget.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Revenge will consume you, Captain. Don't lose yourself like I did.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Have I finally made your list, Pyke?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Rakan, you and Xayah are two sides of the same heart.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I finally understand what it means to be vastaya: we are the bridge between realms.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I know who I am now, Xayah, and I know what I need to do.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Yasuo! I knew fate would bring us together again.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Your brother faced his demons, Yone. Time to face yours.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I won't lose myself to you!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Don't bother running, I'm faster.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I'll make your last moments matter.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I'll show you what I'm made of!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You're not afraid of me, are you?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I'll give you the freedom you desire!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Oh, you were trying to be funny? Cute.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Two tails are better than one. Or, well... you know.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Your warmth... I'll keep it close to my heart, Braum.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Illaoi, all paths led us to this moment.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Your dreams were beautiful, Lillia.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|It isn't weak to move forward, Sarah. It takes strength.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Feltgoodto let loose!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|We are what our natures demand. Right, Pyke?
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Xayah will miss you, Rakan.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I'll keep searching to find others like us.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Xayah, in a different life, we could've been great friends.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|The wind may die, Yasuo, but only for a moment.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Yone, I too wear the mask of a monster. But that doesn't need to define us.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|You certainly led an...interestinglife.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Hmm, a little bitter for my taste.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Life is shorter than you think.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Thank you for indulging me.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I'll cherish these memories forever.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I would never let you suffer.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Refreshing!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Let's go!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Once more!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I'm older than all of you combined. At least, I think I am.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I know this place... Some part of me remembers.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I'm not alone anymore. I can trust in others, and in myself.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I've fought alongside some of the best, you know. So... try to keep up.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Whatever new experiences await me today, I'll meet them head-on.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I've wasted an eternity standing still. It's time to move forward.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Let's create new memories together.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|The trail the Vesani left... I'll follow it where it takes me, and then forge my own path.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|It took me too long to realize how beautiful life can be.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|To stay strong, I hunt. But I'm no longer afraid of losing control.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The friends I've made are very... strange... in a cute way.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|He truly loved me, saw me for all that I am. I'llneverforget that.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|If I look back now, it's only to see how far I've come.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Memories are no longer mine to steal. They're mine to make.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|There's beauty in even the most painful memories.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|This forest brings me back to my days as a kit, running with the ice foxes.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I will always have regrets, but I won't keep running from them.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I'll seeeverythingthis world has to offer.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|The air smells so much sweeter without the Black Mist.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Humans change over days. Nature, over centuries.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The Vesani left so much behind. I will find it all.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I've met so many new people, every one of them unique.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Hidden away for so long, it's nice to finally feel the sun.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Though I've been around for a while, every day brings something new.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|No more holding back. I go after what I deserve.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Never imagined this is the path my life would take.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I lived—and live—an eternity.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Every animal hungers for something.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|As the seasons change, so do I.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|A body nourished, a soul fed.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Nature here is too quiet.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I won't forget what it means to steal a life.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Remember this moment.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Somuch I want to see for myself.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Like this forest, I am wild.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|So many memories stir within me.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|This place reminds me of home.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I carry the legacy of theVesani.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I'm living my best life.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I still remember his laugh...
wavs/audio_0113.wav|There's beauty in even the smallest moments.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I'll have them chasing their tails!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|The world is mine to discover.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I should've left home years ago.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I hear the wind singing.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Live with no regrets.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Mortal lives are so fleeting.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Delicious!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Refreshing!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|How sweet!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Just for you!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Feel this!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Catch!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Here I come!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|What a rush!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Breathtaking!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Run wild!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Can't outrun a fox.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Don't worry. We'll be back soon enough.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Oh, there you are! Come to see new sights with me?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Everything's more fun together, don't you think?
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I'll remember that, you know.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Not even cloud fruit could erasethatmemory.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I may have nine tails, but I have unlimited lives.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Well, that was an experience. Not my favorite.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I see all that you desire. Rawr!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|I've seen your most embarrassing moments, you know.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Let's run.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Quick as a fox!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Light on my feet.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|A clever fox is never caught.
