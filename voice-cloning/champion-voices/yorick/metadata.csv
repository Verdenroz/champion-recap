wavs/audio_0001.wav|It's your funeral.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|That is a lot of flesh to raise.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Even your kind will join the mist.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Yours will be the largest coffin.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I need your essence, great beast.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Your kind is supposed to live long. I am sorry.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Prepare your epitaph.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|No eulogy for you.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|The beyond awaits you.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You are to die.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|"“So many souls to liberate."""
wavs/audio_0012.wav|The mist comes for you.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|The grave is your home.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I'll mourn for you.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Die to rise again.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Flesh that will soon find earth.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You decay and do not know it.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|To dirt, you return.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Scatter their remains.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I am to bury you.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|You will rot.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You are beyond saving.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I will not damn you. I will end you.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|To death.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Your tomb awaits.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Respects to the dying.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Your end is nigh.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|The sword of a great man.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|The king will return for it.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|The blade of the father.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|This blade has performed great feats.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|A sack to cover flesh and bone.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|The armor of someone soon to die.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Mere rags, soon to fade.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|The dead need no armor, but I do.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Taken from one who can no longer use it.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|It fits me to perfection.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Too valuable to bury.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|To slow the fleet of foot.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Cold, even to my touch.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|As cold as the hand of death.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Red is the heart that barely beats in me.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|A vital ornament.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|It pulses with life, as theIslesonce did.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Sometimes the dead can give life.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|A ghastly armament.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|A gift from kind specters.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Stay with me, spirit.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|They'll find me hard to bury.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Gives life when death is near.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|To cremate my foes.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|The fire of life burns within.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|The only warmth I've found.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Don't bury me with it. You can't take it with you.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Even a monk needs bread and water.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Material items, for the material world.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I see thewolf.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I grow cold.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Do not grieve.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|At last.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Feel its pull.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|A profane sacrament.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|An unholy mark upon you.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|It fouls upon touch.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|A curse upon the ground.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|It claims you.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|They say I was once your age, though I can't quite recall.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Your corpses against mine. May the best win.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I have nothing but time. Show me something else.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Those you ride down will soon rise against you.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|You and I share a common goal. The similarities end there.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Enjoy this limbo while you can, for I will soon end it.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|One day, you will take me. May it be soon.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I know you. And I see you always.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|No, Lucian, I haven't seen your wife.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|You remind me that the world is sometimes good... and very naive.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I fight to free you as well, though a hatchet would suffice.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|My army will soon storm your gates, revenant.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Yours is a fool's errand. The world must be allowed to die.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|You think you want immortality. I'll gladly give you mine.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Those souls are not yours to keep.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I pity what you have become. Shall I end your suffering?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Yours is an easy grave to dig, small one.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Ah, missed it. There it goes! Where is it at— Ah! Yes!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Ah, would you like some friends? Nope, can't have 'em.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I suppose I have eternity to think about that one.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|One more nail in the coffin of theIsles.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I can't bury them all.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|My graveyard is full.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|All these bodies going to waste.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|My army grows.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|All things decay.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|It falls, like all things.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Makes its own tomb.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Everything that stands must fall.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Forward, we press.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Mortar crumbles.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Look at the wrong you do!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Your remains will serve a purpose.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Another voice in the cacophony of wails.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|We all end the same.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Flesh torn asunder, flesh reborn.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Ah yes, I remember what laughter sounds like.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Join us in eternity, Yorick.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|This land will never heal. But I will lay it to rest.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Tired, ancient, and half-dead. Still, I come for you.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Let us in, remove your chains.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Yorick, look what you've become.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I am the rift between life and death. The thin divide between breath and grave.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Your human form is so confining. You could be infinite.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|We see you, Yorick. We know your weakness.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I once had honor... before theRuination.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|There is no hope.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I carry these souls to their end... wherever it may be.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Tears of life preserve me.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|TheRuined King'sallies shall fall with him.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|My curse is our only hope.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|What hell is worse than this limbo?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I do not live in hope. I work to return it.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|The dead don't hear you, no matter how you cry.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|One can stare into the grave too long.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Soon, this depravity will end.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|This journey is long, but I will complete it.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|These isles... how they scream.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|We shall prevail. We have eternity.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Tell me of the beyond... in case I never make it.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Death is not to be feared.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|The dead have not forgotten.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|They once called these isles undying. Yet die, they will.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|From the ground they come, and to it, they return.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|All things fade... but me.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The beyond is waiting. Strive to meet it.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Everyone I knew is dead. How are things with you?
wavs/audio_0135.wav|How quick the turn from blessed to cursed.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Death used to mean something.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Our souls are a small price to pay to cleanse this land.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Ours is a fate worse than death.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|I am no tyrant. These souls act on their own.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Hallowed or profane... I no longer know.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|We're dead much longer than we are alive.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I go wherever souls are adrift.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|The constant wailing of souls in torment.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|So many souls, so few bodies.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|It hurts to remember.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|What I do is just. Every horrid piece of it.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|What a beautiful dream is life.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|I remember when I put theminthe ground.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|I do not know what lies beyond. But it is better than this.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Water for the living, shovel for the dead.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|If they could see what I see, they'd long for death.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|To most, life is fleeting; to me, it is quagmire.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Death is not always a release.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|TheRuined Kingwill soon meet the victims of his curse.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|But for the waters, the mist would take me.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I am the first and last of my order.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Do you hear that? It is the end.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I cling to life by the thinnest thread.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|The Mist writhes, searching for a place to take root.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|The dead shall forgive me. I hope.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|It is to the grave, we go.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|The isles were once paradise; now they're a prison.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|This mist has become skin.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Life is but a brief disinterment.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Join me, brother.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Die with me brothers, and be free.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Arise and return to this world.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Walk once more.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|A little longer, friend, then rest.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Rest in your rightful place.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|It's good to see you.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Wake up. You have a new task.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Welcome back, you won't be here long.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Allies from below.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Hello, friends.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Some of these faces I know well.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Ah yes, I remember you.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|This horde consumes all.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Return, and fight.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|I thank you for your service.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Kill, and use its form.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|They rise, they fight, they rot.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|I shall perform your rites!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|What's one more grave?!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|The isles remember!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|I must dig!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|One more step toward domination!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Do you feel it? I ammore!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|We feed, we grow!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|We are stronger. We shall take all!
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Go, take what you will.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Behold the horrors of theIsles!
wavs/audio_0193.wav|See the Maiden? She comes foryou.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Do not resist.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|The mist takes all!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|More, more for the black maw of the mist!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|We are not corruption. We are strength!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|All will join.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Submit. Surrender.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|We devour it. It becomes us!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Even a monk needs respite.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|The bells toll and I respond.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|We all return to our origin.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|My path is a circle, my work never-ending.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|You retreat like a coward.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|A breath between rites.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|One day, I will no longer awaken.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|When we end, we begin again.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|A futile act—why do you persist?
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Revived by the tears of life.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|The shock of resurrection quickly passes.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|We do not die, and so we fight on.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|The beyond is not given. It is earned.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|A fleeting repose.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|There will be no requiem. Not yet.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Our time has not yet come.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|I've come too far to stay dead.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|I no longer feel insults.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I've endured more pain than any words can bring.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|I'm just happy to have company.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Ah yes, I remember spewing idle words.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|You'll make a fine addition to my cloak.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|For you, I won't dig too deep.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|To delay the end.
wavs/audio_0225.wav|I still draw breath.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|To life.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Take shape.
wavs/audio_0228.wav|It's you they seek.
wavs/audio_0229.wav|The ruins of these isles rise to smite you.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Won't you join them?
wavs/audio_0231.wav|The damned resist their fate.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Watch them squirm.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|To destroy the curse, I use it.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|They reach for you.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|This never ends.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|An eternal ring.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Fear not... I will make use of your corpse.
