wavs/audio_0001.wav|You can't cage me for long.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Smash the throne!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Freedom before peace!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Revolution now!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Unshackle your mind!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I do not kneel!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You think you're better than me?!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Sweet liberation!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Bring it all down!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Look! A hostage.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|You picked the wrong side!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Mystreets!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You'll have to kill me!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Conformist swine!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I'llshow you magic!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Free Demacia!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Catch me if you can!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Topple the hierarchy!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Run, sheep, run!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|The crown is a lie!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I'm not going back to the dungeons!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Magic is rising.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|This is the truth!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Long live the rebellion!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Join me or die!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I serve no one!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|There is no king!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|You're part of the problem!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Face what you've made!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Wake up!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Heads will roll!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Diewith your lords!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I am... martyred.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Spread my words...
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Take me home...
wavs/audio_0036.wav|At last... no walls.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|At last, I've come for you, Jarro Lightfeather!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|How much will the Laurent name be worth when your house is burned to the ground?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Well, well, Fiora! Aren't you the very portrait of privilege!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You traveled across the world to die for someone else's king? Pathetic!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Idols are made to be desecrated, Galio.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|The wonderous Galio. Yes... I've read all about you.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Oh, look! A walking monument to ignorance.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Hello, Crownguard! Remember me?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Villainy never knows itself... eh, Garen?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Ah, Garen! First to die for the ruling class.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Jarvan! Where shall I hang your royal corpse?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Bad news, your highness! It's time to end your bloodline.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I'll give you a head-start, little princeling!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Do what thou wilt, Jinx!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Every light casts a shadow, Luxanna.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Your secret is safe with me, Luxanna. Remember that kindness.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Noxian swine, Demacian swine. They'llallend up at the slaughter.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I wonder... is that hammer meant for me?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|You've been to prison. You know how this goes.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Soar through the clouds, bird girl... but the earth quakes beneath you!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Ah... you're holding something magical. Aren't you, Rune Mage?
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Discord is the best chord, Sona.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Do your walls keep others out... or you in?
wavs/audio_0060.wav|You raise walls, I destroy them. Let's see who prevails!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I had to eat rats in prison. Suppose I could do it again.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|The Vastaya have suffered much. But get in my way, and you will suffer more.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Do not mourn your parents, Vayne. They had it coming!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I've done my time, Yasuo. Prepare to do yours!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Shadows are for cowards, Zed.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|These things are killing me! ...Oh, yeah, that's the spot.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Ugh... that was worse than wizard prison.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Oh, theirony.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|A little taste of your own!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Hurts, doesn't it!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|A fitting sentence!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Well, that was satisfying.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Atruesymbol of our nation.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|And that's how we slaughter swine.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|That's going to leave a power vacuum.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I am sorry, little light.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|The great mage rebellion starts now!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Look at all those good little cogs, unaware of the wheel they turn.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|See the remnants of my bondage, and know you can be free!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Breaking out was nothing! Watch me break a kingdom.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Those who wait to be freed do not deserve freedom. Onwards, brothers and sisters!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|So... who wants to kill the king?
wavs/audio_0083.wav|This place has potential! Let's tear it all down!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Their shackles are now my weapons! Ha, how's that for irony?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|They work their fingers to the bone serving a king they'll never meet. I must show them there is more to life!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|No more kings! No more queens! No more Mageseekers! It all ends now!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Time to take what's ours!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Behold, thetrueorder!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Do not allow them peace!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Rise up, brothers and sisters!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|They can't hang us all!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Mages, unite!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Embrace the chaos!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The Silence of the Lambs
wavs/audio_0095.wav|It took prison for me to find liberation.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Every Demacian a king!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Tradition is a crutch for the mindless.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The meek shall inherit the earth.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I'm a man without a country. Perhaps I'll take this one.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Aah, how I missed the free air.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I was born a mage; Demacia made me a criminal.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|They locked up a boy, but let loose a killer.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I will show them a world without lords or peasants!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Only sheep need a leader.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|A man who seeks control is a man who needs to die!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|How beautiful a world is without walls!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Chains build revolutions, one link at a time.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|It will be brother against brother, father against son!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|After fifteen years in the dark, I was illuminated.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Time for the kings to bow!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Good, evil... what does any of that even mean?
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Just sowing the seeds of rebellion.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|A shepherd with no flock is just an idiot with a stick.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|No prison can hold me.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I am no traitor! I am the true Demacia!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Once you've seen the truth, you can't keep living the lie.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|From the rubble, true order will be born!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Conflict brings truth... eventually.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|What can they do to me that they have not done?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I will be the monster they think I am.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|The bluer the blood, the sweeter it spills.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Time to crack the upper crust.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|We will rip the power from their cold, dead fists!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|No more slums, no more dungeons!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Swine and sheep. That'sallthey are.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I used to be locked up, but I didn't care for it.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Question authority... then slit its throat!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Whatever they bring, I'll match it.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|This will send them running.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|A powerful curse indeed!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Time to watch it burn!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|A murder of crows... you know, for murder!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|En garde, blue blood!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|At last, the entrance I deserve!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Surrender your sword, Crownguard.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Might is wasted on the mighty!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|I've got your justice!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|That's all you've got?!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Sure, why not?
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Better than nothing.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I actually feel cheated.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I guess I can work with this.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Ugh! What do youdowith this?
wavs/audio_0144.wav|We'll bring the cataclysm home!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|A crown, a crown for everyone!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Sanctimonious.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|For your own good, little light.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Let's use that spark to light a fire!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Your spark is wasted, girl.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|They always said I was a monster.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Such magic should never be bound.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Chains for everyone!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|This rebellion just got wings.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Now, let's see what's on that scroll.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Fortississimo!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Let me speak for you, Sona.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Support for the cause!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Well... this is going to be confusing.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Ooh! I feel so toxic!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Time to jail the jailers.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|I'm great at doing time.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Now it is I who tries hard!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|The winds blow in my favor.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I'm no stranger to shadows.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Rightfully mine!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Magic cannot be caged!
wavs/audio_0167.wav|I'll make good use of this.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Let's level the playing field!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Call it 'redistribution of magic'.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Share and share alike.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|I'll give it back. Promise!
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Let's see what you're made of!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Give it up!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Cheers!
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Sometimes... you gotta pardon... yourself!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|...Let's blow this rat cage!
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Always stay one step ahead of the law!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|This... is how we make a getaway.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Our chains... are only as strong... as we think they are.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|The revolution must pause... (softly) temporarily.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|That which restrains us begs to be broken!
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Attack, retreat, consolidate, repeat.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Not the first time I've had my neck in a noose.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|I had worse beatings in prison.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|No time to lick wounds. Always hit the ground running.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|As long as I draw breath, so does the revolution.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Even death cannot chain me.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|I died many deaths in my cell. This is nothing.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Let me help you think for yourself.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Return to your master, like the lapdog you are.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|No more cages!
