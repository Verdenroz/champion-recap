Pathetic!
This blade's my favorite.
Enjoy the taste of steel.
Their bones will whet my blade.
Another body for the gutter.
This is no challenge.
Ugh, I lost another blade. I wonder who it's in this time.
The worst part of losing a blade is trying to trace back all my stabbings.
They won't survive.
Only fools pledge life to honor.
On the razor's edge.
I never compromise.
Don't cross me.
There's nowhere to hide.
Your allegiances mean nothing to me.
Let's finish this quickly.
Eventually, my blades will find their way into your heart.
Have you anything to offer but weakness?
Live and die by the blade.
