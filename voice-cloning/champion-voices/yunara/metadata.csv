wavs/audio_0001.wav|I assure you: I am quite patient.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Bear witness!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|No absolution.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|On my oath.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Aim be true.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Unfettered resolve.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|The Eye's judgment!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|The Eye sees—the Fist crushes!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Quyen wu heng ralei!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Your penance.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Cleanse all discord!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Weakness shall be pruned.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Reprobate.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Unyielding.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Clear mind, decisive strike!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Vow-sworn.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|This can't be… the end…
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Have I… failed?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|So much… left to see…
wavs/audio_0020.wav|With vigor!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Celerity!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I will NOT be impeded!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Quickening.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Lo hasaheng.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Making haste.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|To serve no one is to let your self-importance master you, Akali.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|There will benomercy,noabsolution—not for you.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Spilling your repugnant blood feeds my SEA of retribution, fallen one!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|I will seal you away once more!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|You must be from the temple ofKoyehn. Thrilling to see such a place still stands!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Adapting art and ritual for war… Incredible to see which traditions prevail.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Karma, I knew you in a past life, I had hoped we could see eye to eye in this one.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Master Kennen. Surely this isn't how you intend to greet an old friend…!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I'm sorry the spirit has left you, monk.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Seven lenses… You must be fromWuju!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|The First Lands fought off the Darkin… so how did we nearly fall toyourempire?!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Perhaps your wayward protégé was right to call you a spineless coward.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|When the last spirit blossom falls and our communion ends, is it a second death for our visiting ancestors?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|It breaks my heart to see what the people of the First Lands did to you.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Vastaya, the people of this world owe your ancestors a great debt.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Further trials await you, Xin Zhao; but you have not been found worthy.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|I can smell the contents of your flask from where I stand.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Your mask—which of thefallendo youserve, swordsman?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You've kept our techniques alive. Commendable.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Ruinous determination. We meet in kind.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|How curious. I do not understand your modern ways.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Friend or foe, hinder me not!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Had we met under more auspicious circumstances, perhaps we would fight as one; or, not at all.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|So… hungry…!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Ugh… manners!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Those who stand alone are easily crushed.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Return to the nightmare whence you came!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I am yourundoing.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Loathsome, broken thing!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Rejoice! I… got them!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|A blemish upon your lineage.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You never could recognize when you were outmatched, Rhaast.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I promised I would stop you if you lost your way…
wavs/audio_0059.wav|YOUR TWILIGHT HAS ENDED. SUFFER AN ENDLESS NIGHT!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Eyes turned to the heavens—oblivious to the perils of this realm.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|May something of worth rise in its place.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Brought here by your own missteps.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I pray you had no regrets…!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I wonder… what do they fight for?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|'Rar ungaing.' Hope that helps.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|None will lament your absence.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You should have considered your actions.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Another branch pruned.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|It is time.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Shades of punishment!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Set upon them!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Nu vi'en teh'rra!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Unwavering judgment.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Penumbra!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Kaunmay'ta yon!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|What an honor it is to make your acquaintance, child of the First Lands!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|What providence that we have been reunited after— Kennen, how long have I been away…?
wavs/audio_0078.wav|You,again? I will deal with you later, bow. There are more pressing matters to attend to.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Come, Xin Zhao. We must cleanse this land of our enemies once more.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Between Past and Future
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I know not if I am still fit to prune the tree. If too much is cut, a tree weakens—nonetheless, my vow is unshakeable.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Zai tah'lo… Once more, I must wield the sacred Aion Er'na for the First Lands.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I once vowed to preserve balance. To prune the tree. To strike from the shadows—and deliver judgment.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|From the past to the future: two worlds, a second chance. May theKanmeiwalk with me.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|A moment! Guaylaca kaunmay'hai fen. You have been blessed.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|It is ill luck to leave for battle without making plans for the future. We should gather for tea, yes?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|There are countless people in this world. Surely, some of them are worth knowing… Oh! Hello…!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|It's arrogant to believe the Kinkou oranyonereally understands what they disrupt, in pursuit of balance.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Time, a silent, unavaoidable destruction. Reducing even the most formidable warriors to nothingness.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Myth is to culture, as conflict is to life. They reveal what people have deemed most important.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|The War of the False Kanmei—a name bestowed by those who knownothingof which they speak.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Much has changed, and I do not understand why. Not truly.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Sorrow, hatred, longing, hope: all shaping my actions.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely
wavs/audio_0095.wav|With every moment that passes, I am further from the place I once called home.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Each step since leaving the temple has been like… moving through life as a stranger.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|TheKinkouare paralyzed by indecision once more.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Something sinister stirs.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|At least this is a… comparatively, peaceful time.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I recognize so little!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|All must be raised in equal measure, if we are to achieveanythingworthwhile.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|When the eye is blinded and the heart falters, the fist must strike all the harder.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|It seems my time in exile was my only reprieve from… endless turmoil.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|To feel the sun's warmth… The sweet smell of freedom.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Shei-fuwan-kaunmay'hai-au. Shei-fuwan-kaunmay'hai-au.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|A fate that I have not earned is one I cannot accept.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|No answers can satisfy my curiosity. What would have,couldhave been.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The Hobbits
wavs/audio_0109.wav|My fervor unbound!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Ousai xe'wen!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Relentless fortitude!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Yunara's stomach rumbles.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|A battle rages within me…!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I am famished.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|There will be time enough for conflicts later—I yearn for a reprieve. Oh! And some tea.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|The freedom to come and go as I please… never will I take it for granted.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Our conviction seals our fates.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Perseverance. Patience. Providence.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|As long as conflict persists, I am compelled to act.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|My death knell will not ring this day.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|This is a reward for my sacrifice.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I mustn't take a single breath for granted.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|What has become of the Kinkou? Why does the Heart of the Tempest now stand still?
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Who is it that will protect you from my ire?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Elden Ring
wavs/audio_0127.wav|So ornery. Have you eaten?
wavs/audio_0128.wav|AGE OF RETRIBUTION!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|AI'MOUTAI JAI YON!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Sar'han om!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Sever weakness.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Receive your fate!
