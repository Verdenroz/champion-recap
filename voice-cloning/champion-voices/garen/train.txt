Fear is the first of many foes.
Battle the infamy.
We are the vanguard.
I will lead the charge.
The scoundrels will pay!
What we do isright!
Vile scourge.
Show them the strength of Demacia!
I will fight as long as I stand!
Accursed villains.
Victory awaits!
Justice, by law, or by sword.
Demacia...
I will not falter!
Darius, eat your heart out.
Seven thousand and twoâ€” oh, I didn't see you standing there.
Demacia...
Hey, look, I'm holding the world up!
I could do this for hours. Really.
I've got a lot of weight on my shoulders!
Demacia!
Fear is the first of many foes.
Fear not, I'm coming.
Never forget why we fight!
In the King's name.
Forge onward!
Our courage must never waver.
I stand ready.
Our deeds shape the future.
This world needs hope.
I bring justice.
Demacia marches as one.
To protect our land.
Be bold; be just!
For Demacia.
Keep faith in yourself.
We fight for those who cannot.
Charge!
Forward!
For the cause!
Justice!
Extend the hand of Noxus, pull back a stump.
Darius, you are a butcher, not a general.
Come forth, you will find honor in death.
The glory of Demacia will never fade.
No matter your numbers, I will not yield.
Stay resolute!
Hold fast!
Demacia!
My heart and sword always for Demacia.
