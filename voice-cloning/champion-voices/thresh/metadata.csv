wavs/audio_0001.wav|It's over when I say.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Lock 'em up.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Death? No... nothing that simple.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Nobody escapes.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|It's over when I say.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Wretched mongrels get the leash.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Writhe, like a worm on a hook.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|No one can save them.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Any last words?
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Oh, yes! It's about to get much worse.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Round we go!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Screaming won't do you any good, but it's music to my ears.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|There is life. There is death. And then there is me.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Come back.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Hook, line, and sinker!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Torment comes in so many flavors.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|What is the worth of a soul?
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Ah, the sweet tones of misery.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Relax, just... let go.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Oh, the eternity we shall spend together.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Hmm, whose mind shall we snap?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Flesh is a prison.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|My house, my rules.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|I own you.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Closing in...
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Ever seen your soul? Would you like to?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You're falling apart. What to do with the pieces?
wavs/audio_0028.wav|What delightful agony we shall inflict.
