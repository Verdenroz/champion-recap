I smell fear.
Feel my talons.
I will dance in their ashes.
Fragile creatures.
Fear me.
I am unleashed.
Tremble before the power of a dragon.
Behold my true form.
Power flows through me.
Think you're a dragon slayer? Come here and try.
By the blood of my father, I will end them.
Suffer my fury.
The might of Demacia will prevail.
They are nothing before me.
They see their end.
The rage.
What do you get when a dragon sneezes? (chuckles) Out of the way.
Without remorse.
The enemies of Demacia will fall.
I smell fear.
They have faced nothing like me.
The dragon nears.
They should run now.
I go.
Come get a glimpse into the belly of the beast!
They are nothing before me.
