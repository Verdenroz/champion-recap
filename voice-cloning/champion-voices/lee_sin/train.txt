I return to my training.
Speed becomes force.
You hesitate.
Come, test your convictions.
Your skill against mine.
Strike firmly!
I'll see this through.
Their heartbeats quicken.
Your weakness is revealed!
You dare doubt my resolve?
I will crush body and spirit.
Act free of doubt.
Your spirit trembles.
Fear clouds your mind.
Worry not.
You upset my balance.
A flaw in your technique.
I do not teach, I demonstrate.
Break beneath my fists!
A risk I shall take!
Beware the dragon spirit!
Hikuh!
Hikuh!
Hikuh!
Hikuh!
Tong!
Tong!
Tong!
Tong!
I… was not… worthy…
Dragon spirit… I've failed you.
My final lesson…
You are but a gilded reflection of what dragons truly are.
Even in the bitter cold, your spirit burns. How admirable.
Before, we were one spirit. What have we become?
You won a great victory, Irelia. I look forward to besting you in combat.
Kayn, you bear powers you cannot hope to master. Stop, before it is too late.
Draw your blade, Master Yi. I have waited long to face you.
I am the fire of Shojin. Face me with all your strength.
Shyvana, your spirit seems divided… and familiar.
Old friend, I sense the spirits fighting within you still.
Wukong, someone of your skill ought to listen to his master.
Xin Zhao, or would you rather fight under yourother name?
You say death is like the wind. Shall we see which way it blows?
I fail to see the humor in that.
Our foes are not much to look at.
Blindness is no impairment against a smelly enemy.
Enough blind jokes! Stop asking for more.
Expand too far, and you lose your center.
Your technique reminds me of your home: fierce, but untamed.
We shared the same home, but not the same beliefs.
The land will remember you, Irelia.
Kayn, neither path would have given you what you truly desired.
Do not worry,Wujulives on in another.
Send me more Noxians. I have yet to unleash all my power.
Stand up! My training is not yet finished!
Five have fallen before me—let me challenge five more!
Rest, Shyvana.Demaciais not ready to embrace your kind.
Udyr, your rage was beyond your own control.
Wukong, return to your master.  You still have much to learn.
Kings and walls have eroded your form, Xin Zhao.
The wind has come for you, Yasuo.
Your journey has reached its conclusion.
Mercy is no kindness.
May your spirit find peace.
My training granted me this victory.
That mistake proved your undoing.
I do not give second chances.
You had the confidence, but not the skill.
Hmph. Rethink your approach.
My sight may be gone. But my vision holds true.
A fight to the bitter end. I welcome this opportunity.
Many monks live in peace.  I do not envy them.
I will struggle, I will fail, but to surrender is a privilege I do not have.
The weight of this power… it will not hold me back.
They see only a blind man. I will open their eyes.
I did not blind myself. I called upon the dragon, and suffered its wrath.
The dragon blazed my trail. I merely walk it.
The monks taught me well, but I determine my own fate.
The marks on my body are not warnings; they are reminders of the burden I bear.
The dragon must be unleashed, or it will consume me from within.
The spirits live among us; their power echoes throughout the land.
Those who do not know their limits will never reach their potential.
Enlightenment is knowing the value of one's ignorance.
The dragon spirit is not magic; it is life, more ancient than ours.
Ionia prayed for peace. What fools we were to think it possible.
The dragon answers in flame.
My training left more scars than any battle.
I will master the dragon's spirit, or die trying.
My fists are my weapons.
Today will be a worthy test.
I must stay disciplined.
I will atone.
I need no blade to strike down my foes.
I bloodied my knuckles to sharpen my fists.
Endless trials await.
We do what we must.
My journey led me here.
Never again will arrogance lead me astray.
Only I can endure the dragon's fury.
Quiet steps.
Find your center.
Extend your senses.
Waste not a minute.
Begone!
Hikuh!
Behold!
Hikuh!
Hikuh!
The dragon sleeps… for now.
I return to my meditations.
My spirit rests.
I shall not repeat that mistake.
Failure has not stopped me before.  It will not now.
The dragon spirit offers me another chance.
You have not earned victory this day.
Force is meaningless without skill.
Let us see whose spirit is stronger.
Endure!
Keep up!
Stand firm!
Fight on!
Your will, my hands.
