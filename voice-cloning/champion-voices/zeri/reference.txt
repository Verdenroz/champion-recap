No spark between us anyway.
A gift from Zaun.
Catch!
Heads up!
Electrocute!
Ha! Surprise!
Short on sparks.
Gotta fuel up.
Running on empty.
Come on! Charge already!
Need more power.
I'm not... done...
No! I can fight...
People need... me...
Off I go.
Go time!
Bye!
See ya!
Gotta zip!
That's my cue!
Blitz, you used to help me climb the clock tower. That arm of yours is no joke.
A gun and a badge don't make you a hero.
Ekko, you don't have to fight alone. Us Zaun kids, we stick together.
Ezreal, you're the type of guy that's not worth my time.
Professor, don't make me blow up your inventions again.
"Janna, you do exist! Your wind, my lightning. Let's make a storm!
Hoy, Jinx! How many rockets you making me dodge this time, huh?
Pretty songs don't fix problems, Seraphine. Actions do.
A real rat with a crossbow? Can't believe I owe my Dad money.
Vi, you could've fought for Zaun. But you chose not to.
Is that another me? Or someone else?
No one's ever asked me to zap them, Ziggs. That's new.
If I can just, uh, get this to work. Ah!
Nope. Not funny.
Quite the swing, Blitz. Let's have another go.
Well, Caitlyn. Out of touch, out of luck.
You can do better, Ekko. Rewind and rematch.
Liked your gauntlet, Ez. Everything else? Meh.
Back to the blueprints you go!
Janna, come on! Don't let people's faith go to waste.
That's enough animal-shaped guns for now.
Woo, that's five! We gotta celebrate!
Wow, we rock! Wait, where's the last one?
Beautiful lyrics, Sera. If only you'd backed them up.
Look at them scramble! We crushed it!
Twitch, if you want cheese-flavored trash, just ask.
Vi, I've tried punching through life. Doesn't work.
Probably a weird dream. Nothing to worry about.
Do I smell burnt squirrel?
Fried!
Ha! Got you.
Beat it!
I shoot back.
Wiped!
You blinked!
Never count me out.
Downed one!
Too slow!
And Dad said I was stubborn.
You know what? We might die here. Let's make sure we go down swinging.
Yell if you need backup. I'll be there in no time.
Zaun's with me every fight. This time's no different.
Sweet, we're here. Whoa, crazy weapons! This team's great. Let's go!
Ayy, this is cool. Lotsa places to run. Charging up oughta be quick.
No one catches me. Except for my aunt. Man, I can't get anything past her.
I stood up for my community. I can stand up for others, too.
Oh, wow. They're really out to get us. I gotta be faster.
Run fast, charge up, shoot the bad guys. Easy enough.
Grandma said: 'Never back down from a fight.' Bless that woman.
If it matters to my team, it matters to me.
Man, I should've packed more snacks.
Gun's not broken yet. Better keep it that way.
Fight's gettin' messy. At least I'm consistent.
Never seen so little traffic. Do I miss it?
Gotta hurry. People need my spark!
Giving up's too easy.
Do or die. I'm all in.
This won't be perfect, but life never is.
No slowing down.
Quick feet, quick trigger.
I don't leave others behind.
Anyone have a plan? No? No problem!
They're like the chem-barons. Talk big, but they'll break.
Everyone's counting on me. No way I let them down.
Mistakes made are lessons learned.
Best thing I can do is fight when others can't.
I faced worse in Zaun. We can win.
Ah, fresh air. A rare treat.
Lightning in a gun coming through.
Fully charged.
Sparks ready!
Amped up!
Not a chance.
Outta my way!
No you don't.
Unload.
It's up to me.
I'm here!
Drop!
You got nothin'.
Electric.
Quick, quick!
Step up!
Pst, get out!
Nuh-uh.
In a hurry.
Don't you dare.
Shock 'em!
Count on me!
Burst fire!
I'm not messin' around.
Dodge this.
Hoy, move.
Buzz off!
What's up?
Incoming!
Let her rip!
Go, go, go!
Static blitz!
Screw it, I'm mad!
Bolt 'n' jolt!
All in!
No holding back!
Ready to shock!
Hoy! Hear that buzz?
Lightning crash!
I am lightning!
I am lightning!
Wow. Intense.
Aww, Over already?
Whew! Gotta recharge.
One sec! Gun could use a little tinkering.
Hold up! There's a gear in the shop with my name on it.
Wait! I forgot something! Just stay alive, okay?
I owe ya one!
Appreciate it!
Thanks!
Come on, Zeri. Fight to winâ€”remember that.
Ugh, might've rushed that one. It's okay, I'll do better.
Snap out of it. I can do this.Wecan do this.
If the chem-barons couldn't keep me down, no one can.
You wanna mess with us? Deal with me, first.
That's a lotta talk. Let's see if you can back it up.
Boom!
Let it fly!
Ultrashock laser!
Aim and fire!
Here it comes!
I'll get them, I promise!
Ay, my bad!
A spark is all I need!
