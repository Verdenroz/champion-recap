I will not rest.
They will pay.
I will have vengeance.
Fear the ocean's weight.
All will drown.
I will not rest.
Drag them down.
Sometimes I think this anchor just weighs me down. ♪ Ba-da-dee, ba-da-do, ba-da-doo... ♪
The tide ebbs.
Do you hear them calling?
Lost and forgotten.
Find the guilty.
Peer into the darkness.
Forward, forward.
Left to die.
Echoes from the deep.
The endless march.
You are in the deep end now!
Beware the depths.
