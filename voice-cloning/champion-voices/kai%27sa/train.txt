You wouldn't last a day in the Void.
Back in your hole!
You don't belong here.
A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax.
You talk too much.
Settle down, sister.
You want crazy?
You seem familiar.
Have we met?
Something is off here.
Don't test me.
I know your tricks.
You will leave this place.
Not onmywatch, glutton.
Vilecreature…
What are you…?
Looking for me?
Let's set the story straight.
Step back, 'Red'.
You're outgunned.
You call those guns?
This, is not the Void!
Come on!
You will die here, creature!
Not today.
This ismyhome, Void-spawn!
You must be lost, creature.
I am not afraid anymore.
This ismyhome, Void-spawn.
Go back, 'Voidling'!
Die, trespasser.
My suit hungers.
I kill so they don't die!
Thick skin always wins!
This is why I survived.
The hunt is on.
I wield the abyss!
This is why I came back!
You'rethe hunted!
I won't quit!
Just the beginning.
Let's see what you're made of!
You're nothing!
Just for you!
Kai'Sa, remember the name.
Come on… come on…
Come on! Let's go.
Fear me!
Strike hard!
One mistake is all it takes.
I'm back.
Found your weakness.
Power, not hate.
I amnotafraid.
Fear the Void's sting!
Myturn!
You'rethe prey!
Foolish quarry!
I'll be your monster!
Iwon'tback down!
I'm right here!
Hit 'n' move!
Kai'Sa huffs.
Kai'Sa huffs.

Huh? *gasps, then grunts* …huh?
That's one.
Two down.
That's three.
And four.
That's five.
Yes! Six.
Seven.
Eight kills.
Nine lives taken.
Ten down.
Eleven.
That's a dozen for me.
Thirteen—unlucky for them.
Fourteen.
Fifteen, and counting.
Sixteen.
And, seventeen. Wow.
Eighteen.
Uh-huh… Nineteen.
Twenty! Yeaaah!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two! …That's a lot.
Twenty-three.
Twenty-four… …I can't even.
Twenty-five! Come at me!
I'm done counting.
You're now dead, prophet; that is the truth that will be told.
I forgive you, Malzahar… but I do not forget.
Goodbye, Malzahar, nowIwill tell this tale.
For you! For us.
This is why they need me.
Will they now see? I can do this!
Yes! We did it.
That sent a message.
That's just the start.
Coward!
Almostmade it!
The Void's reach is long.
I'll take that.
You can't outrun the Void.
OnlyIcan escape the Void.
They weresoclose!
Too late to run!
Kai'Sa laughs.
The first wave is upon us.
These creatures seek the living… even here.
"That smell… unmistakable. The Void.
The Void has breached this place.
Father?
Reunions can be so bittersweet.
Could it-… be true?
It smells like home here…
Huh… Memories of my father come at the strangest moments.
My appearance may frighten you, but make no mistake: I am on your side, and we fight to the bitter end.
This suit lives on me. It calls me home. We survive together…
Stay with me, and we live.
When memories fade and darkness surrounds you… find the strength inside.
You know that feeling, when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? …That's just an itch, compared to what lives on me.
Here is where we make our stand. Do as I say. It's the only way, if we want to live.
The first time I returned from theVoid… It was to saveme… Now, it's to savethem.
…A cool breeze. I remember these. Reminds me of home.
Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it.
This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void…
I survived the Void—buthereis where my story has its best ending.
The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it.
Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there.
My skin is crawling… the needles… the itch… Time to hunt.
Theyneedto listen to me. Then, they would see that I can show them a better way.
Love… fear… whatever it's called—it's survival that motivates everyone.
I can rid them of these monsters… but who will save them from themselves?
Downthere, I was surrounded by nothingness… but I was never alone. Memories comfort like the closest companion.
This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live.
The skin grows restless… It needs to feed. If it doesn't… could I be next?
When I was a child, I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now, I call it home.
Fight hard. You are a living weapon.
Let go of the anger. It does not serve.
This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted.
I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. Irefuseto accept it as my fate.
…Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa; and you will have a chance…
The Void consumes everything; leaving only emptiness in its wake.
The hunting ground has changed… but the hunt is the same.
Danger is real—fear is an illusion.
Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell, would they see I'm just like them…
The Void willnotconsume me; but I must act, or the others will not be as lucky.
Only a child… and no one came to save me.
Iam the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all.
Maybe someday they will come to accept me. Fornow, they will need me.
Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble.
Anger is useless to me—a wound that will only continue to fester.
I came for the hunt… but I'll stay for the fruit.
Exploit their weakness.
Survival means never stopping—the Void knows that too.
I return stronger than I left.
This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct.
Get up. Stand firm. Strike hard.
I can make a difference here.
Monsters are everywhere.
I like it here, I just might stay.
This skin lives on me, and hunts with me.
Void rule number one: don't die.
Iwillmake a difference here.
It's a good day for a hunt.
Exploit their mistakes.
This world is changing… We decide into what.
This place is beautiful… I'm going to save it.
Thisis my purpose, learn from me.
Forgiveness is hard… but so very worth it.
Survival is an instinct we all have.
Feed the beast… or be its meal.
It's fight or flight, onlynowI do not run.
Are those peaches I smell?
I was spared for a reason.
Hold our ground; attack them in theirs.
Stay alert, stay aggressive.
I came back for the others who could not.
Ah, trees… How I missed them.
A moving target lives longer.
This suit hunts in the mannerIchoose.

Don't be long; we're stronger together.
Don't worry, I will fight alone. I've done it before.
I'll stand our ground while you're away.
That's enough for the moment. The hunt will resume.
I'll be back for more.
I need to gather my strength.
Ohh, how I missed these!
Mmm!
What a pleasant surprise!
Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the… honeyfruit?!
Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the fruit!
Not peaches… but, they'll do.
Thanks for that.
I'll take it!
That isjustwhat I needed!
Ah, that works.
I won't forget this.
Ahh, that's much better.
I needed that.
All better now.
Alright!
Yes! Teamwork.
Nice reflexes!
Whew.
We're stronger together.
Nice work!
Thanks.
Whoa! Nice!
You, are awesome.
Whew, that was close.
Thanks.
In the Void, I had no one; I was a doomed outsider. Here, people are everywhere—and they are all mine.
The Void-spawn offer athousandways to die, andoneway to live: become like them.
I grew up deep inside a vast emptiness—I do not wish to grow old in one.Thatis why we must fight.
"The Void is not so much a place—it is a power, reaching out to consume all life.
The things we carry should lift us up, not weigh us down. Memories, love, and hope… are the lightest necessities.
The yoke of fear is a heavy burden. Hunters must be nimble, and walk lightly.
Some call me 'monster'. They have no idea what lurks just below us all.

Gotcha!
Too slow.
That was easy.

You're all mine.
They can't get away.
Walked into that one.
I knew it.
Prepare for what's next.
They'll think twice next time.
Yes!
That'll leave a mark.
They never saw it coming.
Revealed.
Running, is only half a plan.
Nice!
Found you.
Dammit! Dammit!!
That was pointless.
Do better next time, Kai'Sa…
'Close' doesn't count.
Agh…
Dammit. Take your time, Kai'Sa!
Ugh, clumsy girl…!
They got lucky.
You don't belong here.
Back in your hole!
A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax.
I guess I'm next, Jax.
