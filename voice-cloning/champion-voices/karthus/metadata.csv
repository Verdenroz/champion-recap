wavs/audio_0001.wav|Ah, the kiss of death.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|It is written.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Ah, the kiss of death.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Sleep without dreams.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I crave the parting.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Revel in the undoing.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Release your mortal coil.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Sleep now, child.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Darkness envelops you.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Hear my song.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|The rhythm of your life slows.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Join the chorus of death.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Your time has come.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I sing the word of death.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Die by my hand, and rise anew.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Rest in peace.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Expire.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Angels too, are the messengers of death.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Host of angels, or murder of crows?
wavs/audio_0020.wav|A companion for all time.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Its power grows with time... as does mine.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Ah, the song grows.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I hear the echo of Rabadon; it is exquisite.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|A crown for the king of death.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Its old master served my patron well.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|None can outrun death.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|This crystal will sing with me.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|When death's grip finds you, it clings tightly.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|A tear of loss, a tear of joy.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|What can protect you from the inevitable?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|No one can hide from the end.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|The grave has all the time in the world.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Freeze that moment, on the threshold of oblivion.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|The sands slip away like lives.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Waaao!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Behold your undoing!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|The shell means nothing!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Sing, my children.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Behold my chorus.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Countless voices in unison!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Rise and sing!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Feel the spirits.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|You will not die alone.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You deceive your followers. I will enlighten them.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Death's horse needs no bridle.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|You are but the herald, Hecarim. Remember who you truly serve.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Your light is but a candle in the infinite dark.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Abandon your mortality, and find your precious Senna.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You can always join her, Lucian. It will be bliss!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Lucian! Join her!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|A shell of flesh or a shell of metal? Both ring hollow.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|You give the dead purpose, Mordekaiser. I give them meaning.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Sion, we must free your soul from the prison of flesh.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|You are only the echo of greatness, but I can give you a voice again!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|You may shackle the living, but the dead must walk free.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Death has more meaning than torment alone, warden.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You are on the eve of liberation, Varus.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Sorry, I'm booked through... er, brrrr... forever.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Listen, mortals, as I speak the word of... my cookbook.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Dear diary, met a wonderful ghoul today...
wavs/audio_0061.wav|So many souls await.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|We all have a place among the divine. We have only to accept it.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|My pilgrimage begins.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Solace comes with a still heart.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Shed no tears for the dead.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Soon, all will wane.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You have been dying from your first breath.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|We are forever.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You all die, why not choose how?
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The Shadow Isles sing louder than any siren.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|You are a doomed vessel.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|The faithful never fear the grave.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Truth is what I offer.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|In the end, only the dead shall remain.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Pain is the herald of your salvation.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|May death free us all.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Hear the elegy of the lost.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|You will forget breath, you will forget love.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Death is a song all will hear.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Never hunger, never tire, never fear.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Follow my voice, and slip away.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|You are only the cocoon.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Have you ever felt a calling?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I can give you certainty.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|What trickery is life?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|You are the candle burning unto nothing.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Death is but a horizon.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|A dirge, for those who remain!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Surrender!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Listen and rejoicein death!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Die!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Cease to be!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Sing with your final breath!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Hear me,mortals!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Perish!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|When I return, more shall join my choir.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I go where death bids me.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Death prevails.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I will shred your body, and burn your soul!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|To feel the caress of death for the first time... I envy you!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|The song of your life will be brief.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Your death will be excruciating!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Life clings like a parasite to a soul!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Dead eyes never blink.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I watch.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Death sees all.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Feel the frailty of life!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|You cannot escape.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Your bodies betray you!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Cross over.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|To flee is to suffer.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Agony, ecstasy, peace. Every passing has a beauty all its own.
