Fine. I don't need more enemies.
Got a whole lotta 'ugly' in my sights.
I feel every shot.
Don't stand where the gun's pointing.
Death is always in range.
I can do 'the hard way'.
Not my funeral! Already happened.
Don't go quietly.
Darkness and light.
Keep it simple.
All this pain... it's not mine.
The gun doesn't have a trigger—I do.
Kill 'em twice, just to be sure.
Wanna kill me? Get in line!
Stone channels soul.
Keep your distance!
That's enough.
If you're here for them, you're here for me.
Die again? I'll pass.
I prefer people at gun's length.
Line up a shot while the whole world screams.
I've got your curse.
I don't miss. It's not an option.
Let's establish some boundaries.
Light becomes hope.
I fire my words, like gunlight.
You are mourned.
Rest now.
Be free.
Let go.
Out of the storm.
Pain doesn't own you.
I can bear it.
It's not your fault.
Death is drawn to life.
Lucian!
Shadows catch the fallen...
Together...
One last breath...
My enemies... Myself...
Death remembers...
When the mist came to my island, Demacia's gates were closed. Will they be open when you need help?
Eternal beauty, Elise? Now that's a curse!
Another nightmare? Fine. I could use the target practice while I sleep.
Horsey! What? I can like horses. I can like... things.
Running shouldn't be part of your plan, Kai'Sa. Survive the fight, not the fear.
Only a man stubborn enough to fight me would be stubborn enough to love me.
You saved me, Lucian. We saved each other.
Lucian has a way of breaking down my walls.
In darkness, we find ourselves.
When we run to the light, shadows are cast behind us. You need to be ready, Lux.
I know where the ruination began. It flows through us both.
All this time, Morgana, and you still haven't learned to let go.
'Darkness'? Welcome to my world.
I could free you, but those you've made suffer come first.
Have I suffered enough yet, or do you need me to be a corpse?
Hi, it's me. The one you've been ruthlessly hunting her whole damn life.
I know the most ancient, holy ways to kick you in the darkness.
Left one alive. Bad habit.
When I hear chains, I reach for my gun... Wasn't wrong.
At the center of your lantern there's a soul, wretched and afraid. I think it's you.
You don't own me, Thresh! I'm not afraid of you.
Lucian may think you're the enemy. But to me, Thresh? You're only in the way.
You wanna get my soul? You go through the mist.
Vayne, you can aim for my heart when you find your own.
I know where the ruination began. It flows through us both.
Cats deserve love! Even if they don't need it... and they use a book to hit you in the face.
Only thing bigger than this gun? The mistake you made standing in its sights.
If you've got a problem with me, make it two. One for each barrel.
Don't make this personal. I'm not nice.
Sothisis the terror that waddles in the night? ...Huh.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
Lucian... we'll be together again soon.
We've been through so much, Lucian... Please, don't give up on me now.
I won't stop until the nightmares have nightmares.
Handled.
Will take more than one wraith to ruinmyday.
Boo.
He probably liked that. (Scoffs) Creep.
In death, we fight the same fight.
For the living. For the dead.
Every death is a sacrifice...
If you're only dead, count yourself lucky!
I've seen too much of this—but I won't close my eyes.
Darkness to darkness. Light to light.
So how's this gonna work?
Try to keep up.
You ready?
You're quiet.
If I can handle this gun, I can handle myself. Trust me, I can handle this gun.
The Mist
When there's no more light, I'll carry their darkness.
Any volunteers to charge blindly into a storm of souls?
I'm not running from them anymore. They're running from me.
Come back to life... save the world... all with weapons locked. Thesentinelstrained me right.
Where I'm going, you don't want to go. Seriously—you don't.
The grave is silent. You're buried in all the things you never said.
I see myself in them—in the eyes of the people I save, and the darkness reflected there.
My walls aren't unbreakable... I'm not either.
Too hard, too hurt, too changed... If you're not too much of 'something' then you're not enoughyou.
Sentinel. Wife. A beacon unto damn darkness. When can I just be a person? When can I be me?
No one said this would be easy. If they did, they're probably dead by now.
I'm a long way from the island, but I swear there's still salt in my hair. Might just be dirt from the grave.
The Mist
Love was left, when everything else was torn away.
The more blood on your hands, the harder it is to let go.
It's enough to hear Lucian say my name.
Part of me keeps wondering when I'll run into thelantern'swalls.
I used to tell myself I was fighting back... but I was only running, with a gun in my hand.
I'll get us through this.
The gun's not heavy after all the fear I've been carrying.
My blood still flows, but I'll never be the same.
Out of the lantern... hell came with me.
If life is my curse, living is the cure.
It's just nice not to be in catacombs.
I remember my nightmares. Wish I could remember to dream.
Light should teach us not to fear the dark.
The past is a wave. Keeps returning.
It's always dark on the horizon, if you only look up during storms.
Fear moves like a current.
I forgive. No one else has to.
That monster wants to hear me scream... He can keep waiting.
Death doesn't leave scars.
Lucian thought I was lost... but I was only changed.
Small talk wasn't really part of my training.
Hunted by the forces of darkness? Okay. I can make this work.
I don't carrythis, to compromise.
Fall behind? Follow the screams.
Those trapped in darkness need light the most.
Living my best life! ...My best second life.
The only way out of the mist, is through it.
The screams of the wraiths are so loud you can't hear your own.
I'm here to save them all... living and dead.
If somethingwasn'ttrying to kill me, it would have me worried.
It's harder to hold a hand than hold a gun.
By the time I'm done here, dying will be the easy part.
The mist is not my enemy.
I need you alive to kiss me.
Life from death.
No shadow without light!
I've got you!
No death without life!
I remember my lessons, and the people who taught them.
The last blessings of theIsles.
Bound to the stones, bound to each other.
Each stone, a sentinel.
Life won't let me go...
Every day I fought for my life. Why should today be any different?
Died again? Must be getting good at it.
Death? Yeah, we're acquainted.
To be reborn... am I still me?
Everything that's happened... I just want it to matter.
Am I supposed to say something clever? Some of us have work to do.
First rule of being a sentinel.
Second rule of being a sentinel. Any questions?
No. We do this together.
I was aiming at them!
Same as the old memories.
And all lost in darkness.
You're sweet!
A nightmare. Lotta darkness. Food was great though.
No!
Keep that up, and I'll curse you.
Worked so far.
Yeah, I met someone in there. He's a ghoul. We fell in love, and made ghoul babies...
Not if you know what you're doing.
I can turn into a screaming cloud.
-for a reckoning.
No one fights alone in the Mist.
