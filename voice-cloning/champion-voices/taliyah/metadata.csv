wavs/audio_0001.wav|Grounded?!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Wow... you're tall.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|As before, we will stand against you.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I looked for your kind at the ends of the earth.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Your fire is nothing compared to the desert heat.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|My father always said I was a shepherd's nightmare.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|That looks like it hurt!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|The best defense is a strong foundation.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|My gift, my responsibility.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Don't mess with a stoneweaver.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Even rocks can be unpredictable.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Alright, I've got this.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Every rock tells a story. This one might be painful.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|How did I do that?
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Looks like you're stuck between me and a hard place.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Stand back.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I've given up too much to let you stop me.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|That was pretty much... amazing.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|It will take more than you to break me.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I meant to do that... mostly.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I am the stone beneath your feet.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You underestimate me.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I'll deal with it.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Experience is the best teacher.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Iamthe rock!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|How'sthisfor throwing stones?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Looks like you've got a thing or two to learn yourself.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Our paths have woven together for a reason.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Either way, I'm going to learn something from this.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Sometimes, learning hurts.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Control, control, control...
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Okay, great, that is actually what I wanted to have happen. For once.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You pulled the wrong thread.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Mastery is a journey. Here's your first lesson.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|A rock in my hand is worth two in your face!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Every lesson is a gift.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Oh, good, just what I need.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Courage is stronger than stone.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I'm... kind of amazing.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Like threading a needle.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Beware falling rocks!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|So anyway... bam!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|One stone at a time.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Leave no stone unturned.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I'm still here.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Maybe I'myourlesson.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Time for a sigh of relief.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Every girl needs a good pair of boots.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Time to fight magic with more magic.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Ooh, belts!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Rocks should really come with an instruction manual.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|These boots were made for weaving.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Huh, towers are stone too. Interesting.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|One more reason to keep moving.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Time to go big or go home.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Time to throw the book at them too.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Some hats speak louder than words.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Let's see what I can pull out of this hat.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
wavs/audio_0060.wav|The Great Weaver protects me.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|A little chaos should shake things up.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Time to see the pattern in the weave.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Clear vision brings hope.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|This should make the pattern easier to follow.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|A rock in the bush is worth five in the hand.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|That sand reminds me of home.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Learning is always faster with the right tools.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Better safe than sorry.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Glad they had this in stock.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Glad I could pick this up.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Oh, great, I needed this.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|This should work.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Never hurts to be prepared.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Ooh, I need one of those.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Never dismiss what's beneath your feet.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Watch your step!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Tread lightly.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|It's never good to run from your problems!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Mind your footing!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|You're standing on shaky ground!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Sounds like somebody needs a nap.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Playtime is going to get a little rocky.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|You are out of your depth.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Even the smallest stone can shake the heavens.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Your servants will resist.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|There is no empire without the people.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Better to build on stone than sand.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Remember there is stone beneath your sand.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Shouldn't you be home polishing your Sun Disc?
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Shurima will live on without you.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|You forget your people.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|We have prospered without you.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Close to the ground, the sparrow flies faster than the falcon.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|This is how the desert repays thieves.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|You have poisoned your own heart.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|The sands have revealed your true form.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Noxians... why did it have to be Noxians?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Did the earth move for you too? Did I just say that out loud?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Don't be silly. Scarecrows don't talk.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Don't worry. I don't stay in one place for long.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Another test?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The mountains of Ionia taught me much.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Let the training begin again.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|My learning continues.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Beauty is no excuse for so much suffering.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|You're no artist, just a hired gun!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Tell us what we need to stand against those creatures.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Are Icathia's secrets truly the key?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Life and death are two ends of the same thread.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Sedimentary, my dear Malphite.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I've crushed bigger rocks than you.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Even rock gives under the right pressure.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|You have betrayed our people to chaos.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|The stone of Shurima will stand against those creatures.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Worry is a heavier burden than stone.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Even the most barren desert blooms in time.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Do not give up before the journey is finished.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Our future is not yet off the loom.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|We will not trade the yoke of one empire for another.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|The promises of Noxus are nothing but lies.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|You are nothing but plunderers and poachers.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|The earth will rip itself apart before it falls to Noxus.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Noxus promised learning, but delivered only bloodshed.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I will take no part in your war machine.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|You sure you're alright?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|You sure you're okay?
wavs/audio_0127.wav|You breed chaos like a rabidRalsiji!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|You will stalk the sands no more.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I will mend what you have sundered.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Stone sealed your tomb once. It will again.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Your resurrection has twisted your mind.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|This time, rock beats paper!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|He may be your blood, but we are your people.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|You have a choice, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Do not turn your back on what is right.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Is it hard to be the protector of so many?
wavs/audio_0137.wav|I feel your tribe sleeping below the earth.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I know the power that lies beneath.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Ooh, you're pretty. Guys can be pretty, right?
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Your pattern weaves nothing but chaos.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|How's that for dirt in your eye?
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Want to examine some stone up close?
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Scavengers!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Leave our world!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|We are stronger than you think.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|You are not wanted here.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|It is the shepherd's duty to drive the wolf away.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|You are nothing but a sheep in wolf's clothes.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Yours is the ill wind that begat his wrath.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I knew we'd meet again.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|I've learned much since we last met.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Master Yasuo, remember me?
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Let me show you what I've learned.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Huh. I guess that's funny where you come from.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|That was great!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Some walls were meant to come down.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|That... was... amazing! Let us see if I can do it again!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Great,nowwho am I going to learn from?
wavs/audio_0159.wav|I guess they learned their lesson?
wavs/audio_0160.wav|A stone can't be polished without a little friction.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Oh! Whoa- agh...
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Whoa! Oh- agh...
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Wh-- oh-- whoa!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Whoa-whoa!! Agh...
wavs/audio_0165.wav|The ground here conceals a mighty power.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Every tapestry begins with a single stitch.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Time to apply what I've learned.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Time to roll up my sleeves.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|I'm going ahead.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|The sun rises... I must go!
wavs/audio_0171.wav|A bird's trust is not in the branch.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|The stone here is amazing!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|The earth here... such colors.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Keep your eyes on the horizon and your feet on the ground.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Best to keep moving.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Just when I start to appreciate the view, it is time to move on.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|I must finish my task.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|What magnificent stone.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Every pebble holds infinite potential.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|If I stumble, I have the earth to catch me.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|So long as the desert blooms, there is hope.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|My journey is not yet at an end.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Oh, look, a rock... and another... and another!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Need to break some new ground. Literally.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|The earth calls, and I must answer.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|This world is a tapestry of our own making.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|The sparrow flies against the wind.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|I'm not going to learn anything just standing around.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Nothing ventured, nothing learned.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|No use staying in one place.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|The earth hides many secrets.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|I have found my quarry.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|I keep moving, but my feet are on solid ground.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|'Rubble Rouser'. That could be a cool nickname.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Every stone weaves a different story.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I can't squeeze much more from the stone.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|What I need is some fresh material.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|To conquer our fears, we must move forward.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|True learning is just a stone's throw away.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|The Great Weaver says every lesson is a gift.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Fresh stone for a fresh start!
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Standing still is more dangerous than moving forward.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|I should not tarry.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Every pebble holds infinite potential.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Not all who wander are lost.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Distance means so little when family means so much.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Sometimes I wish rocks could give pep talks.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|The stone here is so beautiful.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Hard work polishes the roughest stones.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|The ground's a bit unstable here.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Time for a clean slate.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Nothing like a fresh patch of earth to clear the head.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Time to get going.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Great! New supplies.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|It is up to all of us to see beauty in the bare stone.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|I'm the rock the river cannot wash away!
wavs/audio_0217.wav|This world is frayed, and in need of mending.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|I know all of this will lead me home someday.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|The desert's beauty lies beneath the sand.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|A tribe without tradition is a flock without a shepherd.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|The world is my loom, and every stone my thread.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|What an interesting pattern.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Woo!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Whoa.
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Ooh!!
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Ooh!
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Yes!!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Woo!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Wooo!
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Woo-hoo!
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Whoa!
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Problems should be broken up intolittle pieces!
wavs/audio_0233.wav|I told you tostand back!
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Takethis!
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Tag, you're it!
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Totally. Epic!!
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Did you see that?!
wavs/audio_0238.wav|That... may have gotten away from me!
wavs/audio_0239.wav|You have to try that!
wavs/audio_0240.wav|How amazing is this?
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Here I come!
wavs/audio_0242.wav|Time to go with the flow.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|You can run from a landslide, I prefer to ride it!
wavs/audio_0244.wav|This... is... amazing!
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Let's shake things up!
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Better to build from the ground up!
wavs/audio_0247.wav|Time to divide the flock.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Feels good to be back.
wavs/audio_0249.wav|There's no place like home.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|No choice is written in stone.
wavs/audio_0251.wav|I think I've learned what I need to here.
wavs/audio_0252.wav|The warmth of the desert calls me home.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|I must push myself harder next time.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Choices. Those are my only true possessions.
wavs/audio_0255.wav|I'm not afraid of you.
wavs/audio_0256.wav|You're not a problem, you're a learning opportunity.
wavs/audio_0257.wav|MaybeI'mhere to teachyousomething.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Go ahead, push me. We'll both find out what I'm made of!
wavs/audio_0259.wav|You're never too old to learn something new.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|Tastes like sunshine.
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Almost better than goat's milk.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|Refreshing.
wavs/audio_0263.wav|Time to make vision a reality.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Girls with dreams become women with vision.
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Action without vision is a nightmare.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|Vision guides the thread.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|Clear vision is best when there are many paths.
wavs/audio_0268.wav|You cannot be what you cannot envision.
wavs/audio_0269.wav|Shared vision unite the tribe.
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Big dreams require a lot of vision.
wavs/audio_0271.wav|You've strayed too far!
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Erupt!
wavs/audio_0273.wav|Rise!
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Burst!
wavs/audio_0275.wav|Maybe you should goover there!
wavs/audio_0276.wav|Up you go!
wavs/audio_0277.wav|Away with you!
wavs/audio_0278.wav|Know the loom. Be the stone.
