The ball is angry.
So strange, they scream.
The ball is angry.
Why do they keep breaking?
We are as one.
I have sharp things.
Yes, I am a weapon.
Protect.
Protect.
Protect.
Protect.
They come apart so easily. How do you put them back together again?
We go.
I hear soft things.
The ball is impatient.
Motivating.
Why are they running?
Winding.
This is a fun game.
This is very exciting.
Time tick-ticks away.
Ravage.
Ravage.
Ravage.
Ravage.
Throw.
Throw.
Throw.
Pulse.
Pulse.
Pulse.
Pulse.
We will kill your enemies. That will be fun.
