You are right to fear my greatness.
Such insolence!
Look around, so many ways to kill you.
Jaw-dropping, I know.
Show some respect!
Twirl!
Go on, amuse me.
Simpleton.
So basic.
Losing is your element.
Here! You're used to failure.
This is beneath me.
I command you to die!
Qi-ya-na! Say it!
Don't walk where I walk.
You presume too much.
What do you think you're doing?!
Nuh-uh. You've got to go.
Avert your eyes!
Saal yun esqu'uña
Give me praise!
Here's some advice: quit!
Don't bring that trash over here.
I love your little weapons.
Bow your head or lose it!
You're going to die looking like that?
Why do you not grovel?
Know your place!
You forgot to bow.
Ugh, look at you.
Waste of elements!
Nobody... touch my stuff...
But I'm too amazing to die...
Put a monument... here...
Impossible...
How... dare you!
You only know one element? How quaint.
Commanding just one element must be quite dull. Then again, it's so you!
Estem qa'eve
Impressive magic. Did you buy that at a discount?
Your magic is so primitive. Just like your sense of style.
Aww, your primitive magic is adorable.
First time seeing real magic? I'll go slowly so you may follow along.
Please, lizard, you cannot copy perfection.
I have a message for you to spread to everyone in your... Pil-tover.
Magic from machines? How cheap and distasteful.
You Pilt-ovans are like flying squirrels pretending to soar like the eagles.
I have great plans for Shurima, starting with you.
We have the great city of Ixaocan. What does your Shurima have?  Sand and ghosts.
Why yes, I believe I will throw another rock.
The jungle obeys me, Zyra. In time, you will do the same.
I am the shaper of lands, and who are you? A nobody.
The rocks don't like you, the plants don't like you, and I'm pretty sure I don't like you.
There are levels to this competition. Better stay on yours.
How proud you are of your abilities, like an ape who just found a stick.
Why are you in my space? I cannot be seen with the likes of you.
I claim— Claim this land for Ixao— I WILL CLAIM THIS LAND FOR IXAOCAN!
Could someone dispose of these corpses?
Failure, failure, failure, failure, failure.
It is exhausting to crush you so much!
Rejoice! You are now part of the legend of Qiyana!
You're welcome. Next!
Not my fault. They should have bowed.
Prime Qiyana.
Recognize.
If you bleed on me, I'll kill you again!
Ha! You even die ugly.
Who were you again?
That's where you belong. In the dirt.
Congratulations, you have Qiyana. The other side, they have no Qiyana.
Oh, good, servants. Carry my panoply to the battle, would you?
Cover the ground behind me. None may tread where I have stepped.
I would say 'watch and learn,' but unfortunately you cannot learn this.
Is that all they brought to face us? My omele could defeat them, and she is 85.
I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I'm extremely good, at everything.
I can tell by your expressions you've never met a superior being.
I know what they are thinking:
We should throw a feast for me, but we'll need something to celebrate. I know! Let us crush the enemy!
Someday, all this will be Ixaocan. A glorious empire, with an empress to fit.
If I command the rivers to flow backward, they shall.
I name this the River Qiyana.
The perfect place to dispose of my enemies.
Ee-shao-can! They will all learn to say it.
I'm not arrogant, I'm right.
cao-mul
This place will be a lovely addition to my empire.
My feet cannot step where lesser beings have tread.
I hate it when they dare look me in the eye.
I will grant this place the privilege of being conquered by me.
If they want to worship me... hmph, I will not stop them.
'Empress Qiyana...' I do like the sound of that.
Being young means living to see all your enemies die first.
Some people are just born better.
Some wait their turn, and some take what they deserve.
The secrets of my enemies carry far on the wind.
Ugh, this place could use some reshaping.
Line them up. I will bend their knees.
Things do what I tell them to. Right, rocks?
If talent were an element, perhaps I could throw some at them.
No more hiding in the wilderness. I demand to be seen!
You know what's hard about being a princess? Nothing.
Hard work is for those who possess no talent.
My parents rule with fairness and compassion. So boring.
Those who find Ixtal do not live to speak of it.
There will always be someone who is better, and that person is me.
It is a travesty to not be carried by servants.
I do not lack empathy. Other people just need to be better.
I cannot wait to be empress. If only my entire family were not in the way.
I wish there was someone else as perfect as me.
I'm getting hot. Where is my royal fanner?!

One throne, nine sisters. Nine tragic accidents waiting to happen.
My enemies try their best. That is what is so sad.
Of course I've mastered fire... I just don't like to show off.
Everyone, your future empress is leaving the fight. ...Okay, carry on.
Excuse me! ...Uh, excuse me?! Ugh. When I return, this place better have a statue of me.
Grass? Oh grass? Take me away from this tiresome battle. And can you also fan me?
Servants, my palanquin. Servants? Ugh, must I do everything myself?
Can't keep me in the ground. The ground obeys me.
See? Even death is no match for Qiyana.
I suppose they will make me do this the hard way.
Did anyone see that?  Well, I'll just have to kill them.
That was no crushing; that was merely a squeeze.
I say give them a win. They're so cute when they think they have a chance.
I see you have mastered the element of wind.
I can see your weakness; it is just, well, all of you.
I have humiliated my own sisters. What do you think I'll do to you?
Oh grass, please hide me from these imbeciles.
I do look good in green.
Brings out my eyes.
They'll never see me coming. What a shame.
This will grow on the graves of my enemies.
As green as the envy of my sisters.
So many rocks, so many enemies.
Let us throw rocks at them and laugh.
Rock is so common. Just like them.
For crushing.
Stone, the foundation of empires.
See? The land knows it is mine.
Oh rock, smash these idiots, won't you?
Freeze them in their place!
Wet, like the tears of my enemies.
Drown them, freeze them, watch them sink.
That chill in the air? It's me.
They always said I was cold.
The best thing about water? My reflection.
You may now appreciate me.
