wavs/audio_0001.wav|Let me get in there!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Show 'em what you can do!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Justtryto get between us!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Light a fire under 'em.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Who wants to lose some eyebrows?
wavs/audio_0006.wav|He likes his food well done.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Well, you made him angry!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Riggle says hi.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Don't mind us!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You're looking mighty flammable right now.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Save it for the bad guys!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is no time for molting!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Hold on to your harness!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I could stop him... but I won't.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Roast 'em!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Beware of dragon.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Wanna see a fireball?
wavs/audio_0018.wav|The fire means he likes you.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Let's have some fun.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|This is a dragon-'hello'!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Fire solves most problems.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Dragons are just cheating.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|He views flame-retardant as a challenge!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Uh... don't lick this.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Just what you need, a taste for blood...
wavs/audio_0026.wav|We'll see if they can hurt us now!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|It's not that I think we're gonna die or anything...
wavs/audio_0028.wav|This'll look out for both of us.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Yep, I feel a bit safer too.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Don't mess withthisdragon.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I think you're gonna like this.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Is it just me or did you get scarier?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Fire beats armor.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Last Whis- Yeah, good, good whisper.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|No such thing as 'dragon-resistant'!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Good luck controllingthisdragon...!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Like you weren't squirmy enough already.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Don't worry, I'll keep you out of trouble!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I'll bet you like this cape, don't ya?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Finally, clothing that'ssupposedto burn!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|...Riggle-approved!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Burn!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Need some fire?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Get that one!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Smoke 'em out!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Isn't fire just the best?
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Pretty coolbear! Have you seen my dragon?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Extra crispy, coming right up!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Oh, look! Chicken flambÃ©!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Uh... Have you and Riggle already met?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|How about a little fire, scarecrow?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Cool eagle! What does it breathe, air?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Who's got the flamespitter now?
wavs/audio_0054.wav|We make a pretty great pair, don't we, Rumble? Just me, and this dragon.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Yep, her name's Shyvana... I think she's confused.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Trick? Roll over! ...Eeeevery time.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Ready? Aim! ...Not at me!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Riggle! Speak! Close enough.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Ready? Play dead! Good...
wavs/audio_0060.wav|He doesn't like towers.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Demolition dragon!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Take it down, Riggle!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Get cooked.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|That was fast.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Ouch.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I was never worried!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You weretotallyscared.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Just how much bigger are you gonna get?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|He's just going through a phase! ...I think.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Who's a good Riggle? That's right, you are.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Be good, and I'll let you burn down a building or two.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I've got adragonand I'm not afraid to use him!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Ouch! Watch the horns... and the teeth- and the tail!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Not the biggest dragonâ€”but the best!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Aw, look at your little arms!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|You need a bath...
wavs/audio_0077.wav|When you get bigger, you're carrying me.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Arealldragons this heavy?
wavs/audio_0079.wav|We aresostarting obedience training.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Is there anything youdon'teat?
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Keep dreaming, buddy.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Hey! No chewing on me.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Someone's on their best behavior!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Did you get into the sugar again?!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I broke you out of that egg and I can stuff you back in!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I'll scratch your tummy later!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|When do dragons start flying?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I know, I'm going...
wavs/audio_0089.wav|We'll eat later, stop pouting.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|This is so not the time!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|You really are a handful...
wavs/audio_0092.wav|We're in this together, Riggle.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Let's find you a snack.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Do I know how to accessorize?
wavs/audio_0095.wav|It's scary what comes out of you...
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Tell me you don't have fleas...!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Where to next?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|...I really hope that was your stomach.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|You're stuck with me now!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Why are you slimy...?
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Now we're cooking!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Warmup time!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Fireball!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Whoosh.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Later.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Now!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|No petting!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Mydragon!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Keep your distance.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|He's got space issues...
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Here you go! Hup. Hup! Hup!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Time for a little snack break! Hup! Hup! Hup.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Alright, you deserve it! Hup! Hup. Hup!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|That... wasn't exactly how that was supposed to go.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Don't look at me like that; it seemed like a good idea at the time!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|And... What did we learn?
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Not a word.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I think we got their attention.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Feeling a little nervous?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Not a great time to be you right now!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|My dragonwilleat you!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|You're playing with fire now!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Watch my back.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I'll keep you safe.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Stay alert!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Riggle territory.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Whoa!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Whoa, who-oa!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Fly 'n' fry!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Raining fire!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|From the sky!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Gotta fly!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Up!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Liftoff!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Whoa...!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Who-hoa!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Look out!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Here we are!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Eek!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Uh-oh!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Yikes!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Miss us?
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Got 'em!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Dragon up-close!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Met my dragon?
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Dragon snipe!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Boomersays hi.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Things are heating up!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Check the kick on this sucker!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Let's get in range.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Ready, aim, fire!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Light 'em up!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Engaging!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I got ya covered!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Nothing a little gunpowder won't fix!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|We've got this!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Watch this.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|They joined the wrong army.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Leave it to me!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Direct hit!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|War stories don't write themselves.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|I can eyeball it!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|I'm going in!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Last one in's on latrine duty!
wavs/audio_0165.wav|I got this one!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Woo!
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Woh!
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Does this make me royalty?
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Sweet! Kinda gross, but sweet!
wavs/audio_0170.wav|It can keep the bloodâ€”I'm thirsty for action.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Some people like backup plans. I like 'charge in' plans!
wavs/audio_0172.wav|All the risk and none of the consequences? I'm sold!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Time to live dangerously.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|If there's a sword for making things explode, this is it.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Infinity anything is pretty awesome!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Cannons versus armor; cannons win.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|I don't take cover. I take cover-out.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|It won't be so much a whisper as a deafening explosion!
wavs/audio_0179.wav|No slowing me down now!
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Perfect for cutting loose.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Nets, snares, vines: meet your worst nightmare.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Time to fill up my dance card!
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Oh,thatlooks cool!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Ooh, I like the look of this baby!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Let's see if this makes it through the first explosion.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Can't wait to try this out!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|I'm gonna need the extended warranty...
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Do you sell earplugs too?
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Is this blastproof?
wavs/audio_0190.wav|ðŸŽµ Let 'em come by land, by sea or air! Send 'em running home when the Bandle Gunners blare! ðŸŽµ
wavs/audio_0191.wav|ðŸŽµ Bandle Gunners, what'd you see? Sir, just smoke and victory! ðŸŽµ
wavs/audio_0192.wav|ðŸŽµ One stump high and ten stumps tall! Bandle Gunners show 'em all! ðŸŽµ
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Mind the fuse!
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Stuck 'em.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Hold this.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Tag!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Tick tock.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Ahaha, you're in trouble now.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Clock's tickin'.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Anyone ever tell you you're a little clingy?
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Is that gun full-sized?
wavs/audio_0202.wav|You're not the only Yordle who knows how to fly, Corki.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Try to keep up, old-timer.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Hey, specs. What's cooking?
wavs/audio_0205.wav|When you find the right gun, you only need one.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Nice suit, Rumble! What d'you call it?
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Eyes on the enemy, Rumble.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Um, Teemo, are these mushrooms your rations or your ammo?
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Oh, Veigar! Tell me all about your diabolical plan.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Aw, Veigar! You're cute when you're angry.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Watch where you're exploding, Ziggs!
wavs/audio_0212.wav|A cannonball is the best icebreaker!
wavs/audio_0213.wav|This is my .357 caliber handgun...
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Please allow my cannon and I to conflict-resolve.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Clean sweep.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Keep 'em coming!
wavs/audio_0217.wav|You should try fanning out!
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Full house!
wavs/audio_0219.wav|Two-fer!
wavs/audio_0220.wav|Score!
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Thanks for clumping!
wavs/audio_0222.wav|How's that for a Bandle City beatdown?
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Bringing down the house!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Who needs a fort?
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Huff, puff, boom.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|You're gonna need a bigger castle.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Dropping like flies!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Hey, where'd ya go?
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Hmph. Cannon fodder!
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Target freaking annihilated!
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Nothing like overkill!
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Now you see 'em, now you don't.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|Get chunked.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Splat!
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Splat!
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Splat.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Can't wait to tell the recruits about that one.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|Any landing you can walk away from...
wavs/audio_0239.wav|I should really start thinking about plan B's...
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Maybe I cut that a little close... Maybe.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Need a breather...
wavs/audio_0242.wav|I was never worried!
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Aha, haha, ha... that was scary.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|I call frontline.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Ibravelyvolunteer to charge in recklessly!
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Locked, loaded, and ready to rocket!
wavs/audio_0247.wav|Sometimes outnumbered; never outgunned.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Let's get this party started!
wavs/audio_0249.wav|Where's the action?
wavs/audio_0250.wav|You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em.
wavs/audio_0251.wav|A Bandle Gunner never turns tailâ€”unless it's to taunt you.
wavs/audio_0252.wav|Get in my way! I dare ya.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|I dare ya to dare me.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Winners don't duck.
wavs/audio_0255.wav|Easy-peasy!
wavs/audio_0256.wav|I just need a point in the right direction.
wavs/audio_0257.wav|I might just drop in.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|If it's worth shooting once, it's probably worth shooting a lot!
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Walking tall.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|Let me get in there!
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Wanna see the fireworks?
wavs/audio_0262.wav|The code is more what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules.
wavs/audio_0263.wav|Who wears a helmet?
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Bring on the bad guys!
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Maybe we should shootfaster.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|Who wants some? You want some? Come on!
wavs/audio_0267.wav|Full volley!
wavs/audio_0268.wav|Double time!
wavs/audio_0269.wav|Fire at will!
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Don't let up!
wavs/audio_0271.wav|More where that came from.
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Boo!
wavs/audio_0273.wav|Nope.
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Air mail!
wavs/audio_0275.wav|Pilot to bombardier!
wavs/audio_0276.wav|Wrecking Ball
wavs/audio_0277.wav|See yaaa.
wavs/audio_0278.wav|Over there, buster!
wavs/audio_0279.wav|Point blank is the only blank I like!
wavs/audio_0280.wav|Hi there!
wavs/audio_0281.wav|Hands off!
wavs/audio_0282.wav|Time for some rearm and redeploy!
wavs/audio_0283.wav|Back to base!
wavs/audio_0284.wav|Falling back!
wavs/audio_0285.wav|Back to the action!
wavs/audio_0286.wav|Up and at 'em!
wavs/audio_0287.wav|Gotta get back out there!
wavs/audio_0288.wav|Ta-daa!
wavs/audio_0289.wav|You make it easy to be unimpressed.
wavs/audio_0290.wav|You think you can outshootme?
wavs/audio_0291.wav|On lookout.
wavs/audio_0292.wav|Eyes open.
wavs/audio_0293.wav|Watchin' our backs.
wavs/audio_0294.wav|Watch the brush!
wavs/audio_0295.wav|Overwatch.
wavs/audio_0296.wav|Look out below!
wavs/audio_0297.wav|Fwooh!
wavs/audio_0298.wav|Up and over!
wavs/audio_0299.wav|Blast-off!
wavs/audio_0300.wav|Just passin' through!
wavs/audio_0301.wav|Shortcut!
wavs/audio_0302.wav|Whoa!
wavs/audio_0303.wav|Retreat...!
wavs/audio_0304.wav|Al-most!
wavs/audio_0305.wav|Eep!
wavs/audio_0306.wav|Oh boy!
wavs/audio_0307.wav|Can't touch this!
wavs/audio_0308.wav|Splat!
wavs/audio_0309.wav|Didn't see that coming, did ya?
wavs/audio_0310.wav|Surprise!
wavs/audio_0311.wav|Thanks for breaking my fall!
wavs/audio_0312.wav|Splat.
wavs/audio_0313.wav|Splat.
wavs/audio_0314.wav|The Gunners
