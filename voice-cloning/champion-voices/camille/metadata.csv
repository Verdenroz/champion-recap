wavs/audio_0001.wav|I will wait for you to be better.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Either attack or run, your indecision is repulsive.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Mind your manners—or I'll mind them for you.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Eye on the target.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|How gauche.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Hmph. You may thank me when this is over.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Don't worry. I'm not finished yet.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Pathetic.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Seek my attention at your peril.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Hostility works, if courtesy fails.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Ego brings everyone to their knees.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Excellence is a trait you lack.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You will be forgotten before you're dead.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I'm old enough to know better.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Watch where you're going!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Who are you to try and stop me?
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Your lack of strategy disgusts me.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|You do not want your name on my list.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|I find your skill lacking.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|This work isn't for amateurs.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Let me be clear: I will kill you.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Don't be crass.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Your limitations will be your downfall.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|You are utterly unemployable.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Know. Your. Place.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Your feeble efforts are... disappointing.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Behave yourself!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Thisis your best?
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You are a means to an end.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I know what I am. Do you?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Target neutralized.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Do nothing if you wish to be nothing.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Don't engage, if you don't seek to win.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|My motives are not your concern.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|How inadequate.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|A weapon's virtue is proven in combat.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I will make you an irrelevant detail.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|You are meek.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Purity of form, purity of function.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Youwillcooperate.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Your behavior is unacceptable.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Your downfall has already been calculated.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Pay attention!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Mind your surroundings.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Progress trumps suffering.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Pattern breeds weakness.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Try harder!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|"""You are strong, but I am stronger."
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You can run, but it won't help.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I am no one's puppet.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Meekness was never a virtue of mine.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|You are in my way.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|You try my patience!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I am the only weapon necessary!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Time to thin the herd.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Money makes everything easier.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|To the victor, the spoils.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Fortune favours the wealthy.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|The right tool goes to the one with the heaviest purse.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|A proper lady employs many methods.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I'm coming to get you.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Running will make no difference!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Only cowards run!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|You will be where I want you to be.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|You lack strategic foresight.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Second-guess yourself. You will still be wrong.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Did youreallythink you could run?
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Where are you going?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|"""Oh, I'm not playing with you."
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The yoke of mankind looks good on you.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Oh my... can someone put a sheet over this hat rack?
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I am not one of your blunt object enforcers.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Don't go looking for something you don't want to find.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Did daddy buy you that gun?
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Less hat, more pants.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Belts? Is dressing like a commoner fashionable now?
wavs/audio_0077.wav|The law protects when it is protected.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|How very... Noxian of you.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|You are behaving like an imbecile.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|You are not thinking far enough ahead.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|'Hourglass kid'? Was 'sundial brat' already taken?
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Child. I've considered every outcome, plan accordingly.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|That little toy of yours won't help you when you're dead.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Shush now! Leave the talking to the adults.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|You might be decent practice.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|It would have been better for you to stay dead.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Do you have a formula for being better?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I suppose I must teachyoua lesson.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|My blades are sharper.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I've seen bigger tempests in my teacup.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Heroes make such nice targets.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|So much time wasted on presentation.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Your antics have become a liability.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|You know... I don't even believe in you.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Your mistakes illuminate your naivete.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Mediocrity is the root of all evil.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Who let you out of your toy box?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Time to cut your strings, little puppet.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Altruism is so insipid.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Run along, girl, and mind your elders.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Shall I wait while you consult your precious runes?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|An island of ruination... heh, how glamorous.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|How about a taste of your own medicine?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Exterminating you would be a pleasure.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Mmmh... it's like looking into a crude, boorish mirror.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|So direct; like most fools.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Watch it, girl. I am your future.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Ever wonder how you became an orphan?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Tell me. Is it the third arm that makes you extra-glorious?
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Oh, your revolution is so... quaint.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Your revolution has ceased to be useful.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|You have become an obstacle to progress. Time to remove you.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|You would look better as a rug in my foyer.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Shouldn't you be on a leash?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Didn't your master teach you to heel?
wavs/audio_0116.wav|We are all monsters. Now, you are just one on the outside.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Here, doggy.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I'm the one who keeps the wolves at bay.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|You are quick, but I am quicker.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Think ahead, or start digging your grave.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I am a weapon. You're some sort of... pudding.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|All flash and no substance.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Oh look, it's the worst of times.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Don't beg for attention—it's unbecoming.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Ha. Ha. Ha.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Don't be funny, be useful.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Amusing!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I hope you still think that's funny when I slit your throat.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Rudeness is a sure way to an ugly death.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|In your case, intelligence seems like an unhappy accident!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I suppose wit varies with intelligence.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Naw... Thinking for yourself must be difficult.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|A joke? Hmm... What do you get when you cross me in a dark alley? Eviscerated.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Mm, that was less than stellar.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Only command what you can enforce.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|You have become obsolete.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|That antique of yours is quite poor at close range.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Bravado is contrary to civility. Much like boys.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Should have brought your A-game.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Your affinity with time has only afforded you more mistakes.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Pay attention, boy. Maybe next time you'll get it right.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|A nimble blade wins the fight, but a keen mind wins the war.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Looks like two blades are better than one.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Is that fear I detect?
wavs/audio_0145.wav|That wasn't so difficult.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Whittle them down!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|All bluster, no execution.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|My boy, no one cares about your silly little country.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Is that the result you were looking for?
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I suppose dying is the ultimate lesson.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|You should have relied on your weapons more.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Today's forecast? Your death.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Funny thing about heroes; they all end up dead.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Showmanship has no place in battle.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Better to be self-made than made to serve.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Good luck in your next incarnation.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|I don't leave witnesses.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Looks like you weren't the hero.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|This is what problem solving looks like.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|You are sloppy.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|And all the Noxian High Command couldn't put Riven together again.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Play in the shadows at your peril.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|This chemical equation has been neutralised.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Bandle Scout rule number one: be better.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Professionals never second guess.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Were you going to stop me? I didn't think so.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|The satisfaction isn't in the killing, but in a job well done.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|They do not pay me to make mistakes.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Remove the strong and watch the weak crumble.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Don't walk away—run.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|When the foundation's rotten, the walls give so easily.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Wait long enough and the cracks always show.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Living another day was not in the cards.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Ugh! Hideous little thing.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|All the class and manners I expect from a Zaunite.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|You never go full retard.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|That... was glorious.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|If blood fazed me, I wouldn't be very good at my job.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|You were a weapon? Boo-hoo.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Monkey see, monkey die.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|The story of your sword is over.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|It's a fine line between deadly and dead.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Ugh! I think I got some on me.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Was that deception or were you really that careless?
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Bombs away.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Potted and pruned.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Bloodshed and the upper class have always gone hand in hand.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Ugh, today just got terribly bad for you.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Don't take it personally; you were simply outclassed.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|This is what a professional looks like.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Problem solved.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|This is not your lucky day.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|So predictable.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Industry always triumphs.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|You are already forgotten.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|So many bodies, so little time!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Your attempts are feeble.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Target eliminated.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|I said, 'Good day'.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|What a waste.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|That was mediocre at best.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|You are inconsequential, don't fuss so!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Ugh, at least die with some dignity.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|You could at least be civilized about dying.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Think you deserve better? You don't.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|I... hate... snow.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|I go where the work leads.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Progress should never be kept waiting.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|I remain human... for the most part.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Another step on the march of progress.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Fear sharpens every blade.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|I ensure the survival of Piltover.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Violence is a means to an end.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Being nice is so tedious.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Progress is served by technology, not controlled by it.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Everything has a place. Forgetting yours is dangerous.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|The task at hand is the only one that matters.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I don't play the game, I make the rules.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|Sometimes scars are the most refined attire one can wear.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|This is simply my profession.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|It's not lies that cut, but the sharpness of the truth.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|I bargained my soul for the progress of Piltover.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Morality is a beautiful servant and a dangerous master.
wavs/audio_0225.wav|My skills eliminate the chaos of Piltover.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|I'm what you would call a 'deniable asset'.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Rudeness must be eradicated.
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Feigning innocence is so time-consuming.
wavs/audio_0229.wav|The harsh memory of one's past does not soften with age.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Regret is what tempers the steel of our soul.
wavs/audio_0231.wav|The luxury of mercy is one I cannot afford.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Results are all that matters.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|I will not be misled.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Society needs rules.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Order exists because of me.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Progress is honed on necessary death.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Elegance never goes out of fashion.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|Piltover will achieve its destiny.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Self-made women need to be more prevalent.
wavs/audio_0240.wav|We all have lines. I may have crossed mine.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Privilege must be preserved at all costs.
wavs/audio_0242.wav|Extremes are easy, it's the balance that is difficult.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|It is not the weapon that defines you, but how you wield it.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|The world is not black or white, but a delicious shade of grey.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|The right word cuts more deeply than a knife.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Technology and I have a... complicated relationship.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|I am employed when negotiations fail.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Sometimes, ambitions must be restrained.
wavs/audio_0249.wav|For the problems of Piltover,Iam the solution.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|They pay me to find problems... and then dispose of them.
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Efficiency is paramount to success.
wavs/audio_0252.wav|Adapt or perish.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Reckless.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|If life hasn't changed you, then you have failed.
wavs/audio_0255.wav|Complacency breeds death.
wavs/audio_0256.wav|"""The difference between success and failure is adaptation!"
wavs/audio_0257.wav|Calculated.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|You won't avoid the consequences of your actions.
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Winning means being better.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|Opportunity rewards those who wait.
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Patience is what separates good hunters from dead ones.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|Looks like I missed a spot.
wavs/audio_0263.wav|A professional is marked by precision.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Precision is the only standard that matters.
wavs/audio_0265.wav|The test of good manners is patience.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|The trick is to be cleverandquick.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|Patience isn'tavirtue, it isthevirtue.
wavs/audio_0268.wav|Waiting yields the most reward!
wavs/audio_0269.wav|Tut-tut! A lady never dirties her hands.
wavs/audio_0270.wav|You will stay where I want you to stay!
wavs/audio_0271.wav|You and I will end this. Now.
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Ah-ah-ah!
wavs/audio_0273.wav|For you, this will be over in a moment.
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Always dance with the one who brought you.
wavs/audio_0275.wav|Stay here.
wavs/audio_0276.wav|I only need time.
wavs/audio_0277.wav|Better to sip regret than swallow death.
wavs/audio_0278.wav|There's always time for tea!
wavs/audio_0279.wav|Character is revealed by when one retreats.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|"""Value yourself first, lest you be deemed worthless."
wavs/audio_0281.wav|If you don't have the talent to fight, atleasthave the decency to die.
wavs/audio_0282.wav|Find bravado where you can, while you can.
wavs/audio_0283.wav|Now you're just being... vulgar.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|Results speak louder than words.
wavs/audio_0285.wav|Your ignorance is showing.
wavs/audio_0286.wav|Bottoms up!
wavs/audio_0287.wav|Cheers!
wavs/audio_0288.wav|Iam the trap.
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Inattention to detail produces shoddy work.
wavs/audio_0290.wav|I have yet to be wrong.
wavs/audio_0291.wav|I am out of patience!
wavs/audio_0292.wav|The future favors the versatile.
wavs/audio_0293.wav|There are two sides to every issue;myside and the wrong side.
wavs/audio_0294.wav|A sharp blade quickens the work.
wavs/audio_0295.wav|Precision is the difference between a butcher and a surgeon.
