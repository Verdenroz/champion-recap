Back to the forge.
I don't like the look of that thing.
We never talk. Might as well fight!
Your sword has no counterbalance!
Give me the ale and no one gets hurt.
Stop building!
My hammer is better.
I do not like you.
This is for my followers!
You like that? I do!
Even my beard is angry!
Ahhh, hitting relieves stress.
An iron will must be forged!
This will ring nicely!
You are a nail.
The workisthe reward!
I will hit you until minerals fall out!
Nose, meet grindstone!
Nose! Meet grindstone!
This is called building character!
I wasworking!
Good,yes!
Fighting is my first language.
I have a hard head.
Enough!
Hold still!
That's a whompin'!
Good!Yes!
Hammer never fails.
Now this I like!
I broke my beard...
Well done...
Buy a joke book. And a clown.
I now like you less. I did not think that was possible.
No.
Stop it.
Problems solved.
Build it again. Correctly.
I've seen sturdier sandcastles.
Bad workmanship.
Shattered and melted.
Mortal craftsmanship,please.
Heheh, broke that real good.
Whoops. Found a flaw.
Too much sorcery, not enough elbow grease.
It's always the magic parts that break.
Honestly, though, I was just leaning on it.
Heh, not one of mine.
Barely touched it.
Easy build, easy break.
A strong sneeze would've had the same effect.
Demolished! Easy.
Spy on that.
There, fixed that for you.
Was like that when I found it.
Not on my watch.
Early warning is key.
Heheh! Broke it real good.
Ahhh.
Job complete.
Fixed!
Back to work.
That fixed everything.
Well, that happened.
Mhm. Yup. Dead.
That's done.
Character built.
It has not been a pleasure.
Nailed it.
Job done! Time to go home.
That was more fun than I expected.
Could do without the statues.
Decent stonework.
Hmm...Noxiangranite. Respectable choice.
The architecture here is not wholly terrible.
Walls are fine.
Huh, loose cobblestone. Will fix later.
I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother.
Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!
Singed fur... jealous blood... my brother is near!
I have fur. It is soft. Do not hug me.
If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well.
The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... mmm.
I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... 'Hammer.'
TheFreljordis a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home, sweet home.
Name's Ornn. No further pleasantries needed.
I will go over there. It looks quiet. It will be nice.
I am going this way. Do not follow me. Please.
I did not want to cool off, but this feels nice.
Volibear made the first river. You do not want to know how.
Hmm, this river needs a dam.
It is childish to favor one tool over another! But Hammer is my favorite.
Bah, look at all these lazy trees.
Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure.
This world has potential. Needs hammering.
I do not need company; only a wall, to keep out company.
Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods.
I had followers once. They tried.
A day away from my forge is a day wasted.
The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good.
My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel.
Luck is failure that failed.
All I need is myself, and... Hammer.
Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer...
I enjoy being alone. Fewer unintended casualties.
I will make an axe that is also a sword... and possibly a spoon.
My forge is my home.
Solitude always meets my expectations.
The last time I ate a plant was never.
The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins...
'Ornn builds things, go see Ornn.' Nobody ever says thank you.
Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again.
Everything is better when it is molten; lead, iron, chocolate cake.
Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century.
Do not waste that.
Ornn tested, Ornn approved.
A good axe will fell a tree. A great axe will fell an army.
The weapons I forge do not have names. They have ambitions.
No exchanges.
That is for wielding,notfor entertaining.
You may be worthy of that. Do not prove me wrong.
I didn't make that. You didn't buy it.
Huh. You are not entirely an arse.
You remind me of a young me, who was less impressive.
Working with you is almost like working alone. Almost.
Something you should know about me...
I was looking at that one too.
Your job is not dying.
This does not mean we are friends.
Do not hang that on a wall.
If you want a weapon, here's a weapon. If you want conversation... here's a weapon.
That is what good looks like.
That's a weapon... you know, for fighting.
I trust you know how to use that.
You will not be disappointed.
Hmm.
Good... yes.
I taughtDoraneverything he knows.
Hmm.
Hmm...
Ahh.
Don't start without me!
Hot stuff!
My horns are on the way!
Hooold!
I'm on my way. Stop asking.
You each owe me a beer!
You requested my aid!
Hooooold!
Incoming!
Hold!
Hold!
Horns first!
Everyone get behind me!
This will be fun!
Ready for this?!
Fire up the forge!
Turn up the heat!
Fine! I will intervene!
We fight now!
Into the fray!
Hmph. Never mind.
Changed my mind.
I didn't die. My forge missed me.
Rekindled the old furnace.
Still no water in the fountain.
I'm used to this level of disappointment.
'We're ready, Ornn, we'll be right behind you'...
Good job, everyone.
Just leave everything to me, as usual.
I do not care at all.
I do not care at all.
This is a waste of my time.
I don't know what you do and I don't care.
Your base is that way! Go cower in it.
Whatever you want, the answer is 'go away.'
Here we go.
Efficient travel method. I approve.
Hmm, this is fast, but it can't be good for you.
I swear, if Volibear is there...
I prefer walking... but, fine.
Time to show them the horns.
A fight's where I want to be.
I love a surprise.
I'll just drop by.
They won't be ready for me.
A good workman is needed.
That hit the spot.
Whatever this drink is made of, it is working.
Fuel for the old hearth-fire.
Hmm, cherry flavored. Not bad.
Heyyy, this is pretty good stuff.
I don't know how to feel about this thing, but okay.
Is it on?
Hmm, that all it does? Okay.
You stay here.
I do not like surprises.
Fine, we go.
