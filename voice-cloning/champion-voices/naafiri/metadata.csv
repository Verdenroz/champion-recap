wavs/audio_0001.wav|We won't be muzzled.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|You arenotthe apex.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Limb from limb!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Mangle it.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Fight or flight, morsel!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Does it bleed?
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Just a nip!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Lesser creature!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|As one!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Rend its flesh!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Hackles raised!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Wedaredyou to run!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|There's our prey!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|It fears us!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Now, we charge!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Push them out!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Run, rabbit.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Are you hurt, little bird?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|We taste it!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Teeth in their throats!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Sweet marrow!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Tail... between... legs...
wavs/audio_0023.wav|We smell... nothing...
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Our hunger... fades.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|The chase... ends...
wavs/audio_0026.wav|The chase... ends...
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Our hunger... fades.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|We smell... nothing...
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Tail... between... legs...
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Stubborn Aatrox, so driven to die.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Focus your rage, Aatrox. The pack needs you!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|How fast can you run, cat?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Rhaast, is that you? Love the new vessel!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Still struggling with your vessel, Rhaast? How unfortunate.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Targonians...
wavs/audio_0036.wav|My, my—aren'tyoufull of delicious bones?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|It smells of the desert winds... It is Shuriman.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|You always were the reasonable one, Varus; so back away.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Do not pity us Varus—we are now greater.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Wretched yordle. What's the point of chasing something that doesn't try?!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Still some meat on those metal bones...
wavs/audio_0042.wav|A wolf with no pack? No wonder you howl!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Yordle!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|We should thank you, Myisha. You showed us the way.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Find a hole, vermin... and hide yourself away.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|So, the trail of stench ends here. Hello, prey...
wavs/audio_0047.wav|It does not bark. It is not brethren...
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You're a long way from the den, pup...!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Shake it ragged, snap its neck!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Don't expect us to roll over and beg.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Hear the gnashing of innumerable teeth!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|What creature isfoolenough to hunt in our domain?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|We can hear your heart racing, little bird...
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Who's a good dog? ...We are.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I'm sorry; did you wish to smell my backside?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I'm sorry; did you wish to smell my backside?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Who's a good dog? ...We are.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|At long last—enough bones for us all!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|At long last—enough bones for us all!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Bury it for later.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Pick it clean.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Wallow in their remains.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Tastes like terror...
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Kill its offspring, so we may thrive!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Death from a thousand bites!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|No! Savour it...
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Each gets a turn at the carcass!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Ugh, all gristle.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Bury it for later.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Pick it clean.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Wallow in their remains.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Tastes like terror...
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Kill its offspring, so we may thrive!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Death from a thousand bites!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|No! Savour it...
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Each gets a turn at the carcass!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Ugh, all gristle.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|TheDarkinrise. Five sets of teeth in a ravenous maw.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Calloused by the burning sands ofShurima. What can harm us, in this place?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|One mind, spread among many vessels; this, is the way of the pack.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|What chance will the world have, when the Darkin hunt as one?
wavs/audio_0082.wav|It's not the strongest who survive—it's the most united.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Let the world hear our howls and know that death awaits.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Why beg for scraps? Our meal is the entire feast!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I could've led them. I could've dominated. But, there is noI... onlywe.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Our kind had such a proving ground, once. All it proved was avarice.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|We never release our bite, even if the blood chokes us.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Shurima gave me knowledge, the pack gave me wisdom.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Ego is an illusion. A survival trick, for a feeble mind.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|We track for a thousand years. None can flee for that long.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|The tragedy of the kill is that it ends our chase.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|A dune hound leaves nothing. Not even the bones!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The jaws of victory have many teeth!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The lone dog eats small game.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Coordination, not chaos.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|It's lonely at the top of the food chain!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Prey is near... Approach with tact.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Even the strongest can be overwhelmed.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Find their burrows! Ravage their warrens.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|We do not cower from a raised hand.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Humans are petty—tear at their pride.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The world is full of such savory little birds...
wavs/audio_0103.wav|What game skitters by, unaware of death?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Unbroken, and unleashed!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|One learns to step quickly across hot sand.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Humans use more words, but say less.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Together, we ascend once more.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|We've picked up a scent!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Nothing tastes better than the heels of fleeing prey!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|One covers less ground on two legs.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|When the moment is right...
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Ahhh, the stench of panic!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Sunborn, but pack raised.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|The faster they run, the sweeter the meat.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Even Darkin need to eat.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Let us expand our feeding grounds.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Let's get some blood on our muzzles.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The best defense is to bite first.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|There is no alpha, there is only the pack.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|The pack increases!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Welcome, fellow hound.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|We are more!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Go forth, vessel.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Our number grows!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Knives abound.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|More mouths, more bite.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|The pack increases!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Welcome, fellow hound.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|We are more!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Go forth, vessel.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Our number grows!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Knives abound.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|More mouths, more bite.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Smells like conflict. We must prepare!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|This is not slinking away, this is regrouping!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Let us rest elsewhere—never where we feed.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|This is not the feeding hour. Not just yet...
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Back to the den!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|The knives pull us homeward; the pack abides.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|A good hound never forgets the way home.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Our tail wags.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|The pack is grateful.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Ahh yes, right behind the ears!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Our tail wags.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|The pack is grateful.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Ahh yes, right behind the ears!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|They think us beaten... But we've got their scent now.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|That was just... playing dead.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Our pack has thinned, but what remains is stronger!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|No time to lick wounds—we must bite the hand that struck us!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|They take us for a lapdog. Let us show them our teeth!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|We stagger on, parched as the desert dunes.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Famished. A meal would set us right...
wavs/audio_0154.wav|That which cannot die, will in time devour all.
