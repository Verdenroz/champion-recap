wavs/audio_0011.wav|CanI squeeze blood from a stone...?
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Hold still! Gonna sharpen my teeth.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Just one pat...!

wavs/audio_0018.wav|You protect, I attack!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|No blood for you, Sion!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I don't like you, Sion!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Ooh, Talon! Show me your blades!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Not sharp enough, Talon!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|You smile in fear, Vlad!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Let's compare fangs, Vlad!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Well, hi!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I'll savor this.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Fight...? Fight!!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Isn't this fun?

wavs/audio_0035.wav|Stomach's rumblin'...!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Who gets first bite?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Biting's allowed!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|I wasmadefor this!

wavs/audio_0040.wav|They always run!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|You're afraid!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Still hungry!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Mouth... dry!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Bleed!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Tasty flesh!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Just a bite!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Sus-te-nance!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Won't stop!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|But I'm not full yet...
wavs/audio_0050.wav|That's not my... stomach rumbling...
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Oh, Sion! You escaped too? And you're here... with me.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|We fightsodifferently, Sion—you're like 'eurrghhhh', and I'm like, 'nomnomnomnomnomnomnom'. You know?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|(Whispering) Talon! Is this a brand new super-secret murder-mission?
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Hey Talon, uh, what's the point of sneaking up on your target if they're gonna die either way?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Soo... You uh, you want me to call you 'Vlad' or 'Dad'?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Hi! Is this the part where we break legs?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|We don't have to fight! You could just... 'share' your blood!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|See these wax seals on my belt? Yeah, I earnedallof them.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|PREY! WEAK AND... Sorry, old habit, uhh... hi!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|You're nervous. Is it the pillory? I can take it off.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Ooh, that was fun!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Let's go again!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Phew!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I'm not just a living weapon! I can do this, and this, and...this, too!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Oh, I was supposed to laugh at that! Ehe, um-- HA HA HA HA HAA!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|ALL THE BLOOD IS MINE!!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Boring Sion tastes like leather!!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Oh nooo. Sion's dead? I am so sad. I'm lying!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Traitorous Talon, you chose this!!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Aw, Talon... I- I'll save your blood so they can do the hemomancy thing!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|You've become lazy, Vlad!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Eugh,that'swhat you use blood for?!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I'm nippy when I'm hungry.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Killing's different now... like food I can't swallow.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Aw, dang it! Forgot toaskif I could have their blood.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Coulda used some more self-control-- Likeme!!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|BLOOD! Blooood...
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Stuck in my teeth!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Hands off my meal!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I WIIIN!!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|A new taste!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Ahh, satisfying!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|MINE! Mine...
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Nom nom nom nom nom nom!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Remember. You can choose. Don't need to cut loose right away... You.Can. Choose.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Let's see! Today, I'm going to... Climb a tree, learn the Noxian anthem, kill my enemies, and... Oh! Make a baby laugh.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Okay... so, I can go that way... oh, that way, or... that way. Ugh, so many choices! How do you all get anything done?!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Whose blood are we gonna spill today! I mean... drink. No... share? Ugh, what else do you do with blood...
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Ah, finally. I needed a break from the city. Don't care where I'm going, as long as I'm moving.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Noxus doesn't care if you're different, just that you're strong. And I'm strong... reeeeal strong!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|What were the principles of strength again? Look the enemy in the eyes, hit them before they hit you, and be the last one standing...?
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Feels like my hunger's always talking to me... I never understand what it's saying, but I know it'sneverhappy.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Books are magical! All I have to do is look at a bunch of squiggly lines and I become more powerful! Without any killing at all! Magic!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I'm not a picky eater—whether it's a splash of blood, a bloody limb, cold blood, warm blood... I'll try it all!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|If sweaty animals are salty... does that mean there are sweet ones too? Ooh! Or sour?!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Today's mystery: handshakes! Why—are they testing strength or, maybe, marking each other's scents? Hmm...
wavs/audio_0097.wav|People thinkwaytoo hard about fighting. Just point the strongest soldier toward the biggest enemy! Almost worked for me...
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I once heard someone say they're having 'friends' for dinner And people sayI'mhungry!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|When I cut loose, I feel, hear, and see everything! I can just... be.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Everybodywantsto kill and eat, but they're all too embarrassed to do it!I'mnot!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Ears have a nice mouthfeel. Very chewy.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Nature's more outta control than I am!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Argh, moving on four limbs was so much easier!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|My teeth are bored.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|If I can taste through my nose... why can't Ieatthrough my nose?
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Food doesn't have to be blood?! Ha.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|My stomach's louder than my mouth...!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Of course! Mouths water... because they're crying for food!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Is life the hunger of death...?
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Hmm... When people talk about their 'first language', why isn't 'body language' an option?
wavs/audio_0111.wav|It is not polite to nibble on friends!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I might be a weapon, but now onlyIwield myself!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I don't lose control—Ifreemyself from control.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Aww, my hair's fading already? And I'm fresh outta blood!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|FOUND YOU!!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|NO RUNNING!

wavs/audio_0120.wav|Aaaand...Stillhungry.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Wow! Dyingreallyclears up the sinuses!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Did that happen because I hadtoomuch control... or, not enough?
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I did it! I failed the same way everyone else does! ...Averagely.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|heartbeat
wavs/audio_0125.wav|BWAAAHHH! Heh, scared ya.
