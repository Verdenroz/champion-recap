My genius will be understood—eventually.
Right. On. Cue.
Wonderful.
There is no drama in a peaceful death!
Symmetry is so boring.
Each bullet will be a dance.
Places everyone, places!
Sublime.
Watch my puppets dance.
Precious.
When they find you, they will cry.
Smiles, everyone, smiles!
I couldn't miss your performance.
I've outdone myself this time.
Center stage!
Beauty is pain.
Your life had no value before me.
You will be poetry.
You will be beautiful.
I feel inspired.
Transcendent.
Delightful!
Shall we dance?
Youwillperform.
Each bullet is a song.
How lovely!
Alright!
This is my love.
Places, please!
The composition needs something.
Darling.
I will touch your heart.
How can we make this fresh?
I rehearsed this!
Art is worth the pain.
I will make you famous.
Inspired.
Dance for me.
This is my calling.
Divine.
Fabulous.
They're gonna live, until they die.
The show never ends!
This is your curtain call.
Two!
Two.
Three.
Three.
One!
One.
These were clearly designed by a caveman.
Gold is my power colour.
I prefer my equipment to make a bang.
Sometimes, silence is loud.
Start the music. I will make them dance.
I have a thirst for melodrama.
Redisa primary color.
The storm is in their hearts. I calm them.
Dune
I do prefer my work to have a brisk tempo.
I always execute with style.
We all wear masks. Mine are just better-crafted.
Art is such a fickle thing.
Not sure I needed another mask, but oh well.
Ionian footwear. Sadly, so obvious.
The essence of a thing is found only in its absence.
Life has no meaning, but your death shall.
Face the crowd, and bleed for them.
Nowthatis what I want to see.
The face of your killer is identical to mine.
Art shall blossom from your fear.
With my technique, killing blooms into artwork!
You've awoken something deep inside me.
I knew you would find your mark, eventually.
Wait for your cue! You're only here to herald my entrance.
What a terrible arrangement.
You shout and throw machetes? How quaint.
I find your work very, very… obvious.
Clearly you've never performed in Ionia.
The always-enchanting tale of star-crossed lovers.
Here's the thing, I don't need your god, I need more time for my production.
There is such a thing as 'too much gold', my dear.
I thought diamonds were a girl's best friend.
When you speak, I don't hear god, I hear an idiot babbling.
You can take my soul… if you'll shut up.
I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past.
The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions.
You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast.
My dear countryman, you remind me how little our culture has advanced.
I do what others will not. That alone is innovation.
So many guns, all lacking in meaning or artistry.
Your finale will be a duet.
Your story is revenge with gunsandghosts. How droll.
How gauche your nation is.
Your war was an impressive production, but it lacked soul.
Your people mistake loudness for import.
I've been asked to do so many boring performances in your nation.
Noxians treat killing as a sport. It is an art.
I suppose you embody a primitive minimalism, but you lack my technique.
Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered.
You helped lock me away. You tried to stop my work. My art cannot be contained.
I have been planning your final performance for a very… long… time.
I remember your father! He thought he could censor me.
Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in.
Break a leg! Hehe, oh. 'Break a leg', hehe… ah, delightful. I do cut myself up.
Your music lacks the cruelty of a masterpiece.
Step out of my light! They call it background music!
Your work will be forgotten. I am ahead of my time!
You should learn the power of silence.
You have too many lines.
Oh, before you ask, yes, your whole ensemble makes you look fat. Very fat.
Why would anyone listen to a creature so ugly?
How inelegant your words are. Surely a fool wrote your script.
Heh… hehe… that hat is ridiculous, now… who let you wear that horrible thing?
An understudy can't upstage me.
You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance.
You belong in the shadows. No audience could love you.
I remember your master. He was worth remembering.
I offer an exclusive service. You'll find I murder the competition.
You think you can stop my performance?
You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed.
Only perfectio-gah! … only perfection is acceptable.
And now, the curtain rises.
This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it.
The stage is set.
Our performance begins.
I suppose I must make do with this tawdry setting.
I will bring them an opera of death.
I serve a discerning clientele.
Let's start the show.
My work asks questions, it never has answers.
Which is the lie? The mask, or my face?
The trigger on a loaded weapon… it whispers for us to act.
A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood.
If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work?
I… orchestrate death.
I will not suffer this ugliness.
My audience awaits.
The work is what matters.
Art should terrify.
Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly.
I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs.
I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills.
I envy silence… because I must be loud.
Happiness… is a warm gun.
They call me mad. All artists are mad.
I must wait until the composition is perfect.
Smiles and screams, I bring both.
My critics are… usually short-lived.
My clients expect the best.
An icon doesn't have to explain himself.
I am at my best only during the performance.
Mmm… the ecstasy of killing.
The ecstasy of opening night.
This would be easier if blood came in more colours.
If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed.
The moment before the shot… is painful.
My talent justifies all actions.
Until they stop me, I will keep going.
It's so difficult to work under these conditions.
It is only when the gun fires that I am alive.
Behind every mask there is a face, and behind that a story.
I like a violent composition.
I am pure. My work is pure.
I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do.
There is nothing for me but this.
Only to the audience do I show my true face.
The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly.
No poet's words could match my craft.
My theater is the mind.
I cannot be good. I must beperfection.
This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it.
I can't live without the euphoria of performance.
Death should never be quick. It should be an opera.
They will dance, they will sing, they willdie!
I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time.
Yes, the gun is ironic.
Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own.
I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling.
Perfection isn't good enough.
Art must exist beyond reason.
Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me.
My genius will be understood - eventually.
I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims.
I wonder what they think when they see me.
I am a slave to this passion.
Every element must be in place.
What sweet sadness is killing?
I was paid to put on akillershow.
The end is important in all things.
I shall choreograph this affair.
Art requires a certain cruelty.
It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance.
Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire.
I inspire action.
Through my work, you shall transcend.
You will learn what beauty truly is.
One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four.
There is art here, waiting.
Smile! Everyone is watching!
You… inspire me.
Breathe in the atmosphere.
This… passion… compels me.
Four.
Four!
Four!
Your final scene begins.
Prepare… for your finale.
That delightful moment before the curtain goes up.
In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn.
I have risen from the filth and muck. I am the lotus blossom. I am beauty.
It hurts so good…
You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you.
I have elaborate plans for you.
You lack imagination.
Killing you will be one of my finest works.
Only my actions will make you memorable.
In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn.
