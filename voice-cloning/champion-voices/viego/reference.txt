My heart was already broken.
Fall beneath my blade!
Deny me no longer!
Why do you fight?!
I am inevitable.
Ruin to all!
All shall know my pain.
Stand aside, churl!
This is my decree!
The mist beckons!
I will break your heart.
You face the ruined king.
Be one with the mist.
Serve me in death.
I must have her back!
Peasant!
Bring her back!
Return her to me!
You dare face a king?!
Love is my weapon!
She would want this!
You would stop me?
Tell me where she is!
Be brought to ruin.
My love! My love!
Where is she?!
You stole her from me!
Die for her!
Anything for her.
Lowborn filth.
The mist devours all!
Isolde... why?
My heart beckons!
Grant me passage!
Flow from me!
Spill forth!
Find her!
Forward, mist!
Consume everything!
Ur-demon. When all life ends, you will return to your slumber.
For all your ambition, Hecarim, this is what you are reduced to.
Your god could not stop me before, sea priestess. Do not challenge me again.
You will never have your vengeance, Kalista. Never.
Sing, Karthus. Sing of all that must be lost and she who must be found.
Answer for your crimes, death. Answer me.
Go on then, tree. Defeat me if you can. It will never restore the isles.
Awake, O lord, wouldsâ€™t thou reject us forever? Why do you hide your face and forget us?
Your treachery does not surprise me, Thresh. Only that you believed you'd win.
Hello, uncle. I'm surprised you haven't been torn apart by an angry mob.
Ah, the monk from the waters. And... someone else. Isolde?
Humor was better a thousand years ago.
Sorry, went down the wrong pipe.
Mist, get out of my lungs, I command you.
I demand this!
Give me your heart!
No power in this world can stop me!
You will serve!
Kill them! Kill them all!
This body is mine!
Surrender yourself!
Now, do as I say! Forward!
This body, is this what you desire?!
In death as in life, Hecarim. You will fight only for me.
You never believed in my rule, Kalista, and now, this is your fate.
Arise, death, and greet the king who conquered you back!
All this carnage. Do you see?! I do it for you!
Isolde... I could not see myself in your eyes.
You are simply the latest to defy me, jailer.
So angry, uncle. It was one unanswered letter a thousand years ago.
Isolde! I know it is you! Show yourself to me!
Your pain is nothing compared to mine.
The dead will not rest until I am whole once more.
Every living thing is my subject!
Love is cruel. Yet, it will conquer.
I will find my love again. You matter so little.
The weight of this moment is so much more than you.
This flesh will do.
You are not the hero of this tale. You are not anything.
Take me to her! Now!
She waits for me beyond the mist. My queen. My love. My black and broken heart.
No price is too great. No atrocity beyond my reach. For her,I will do anything.
Submission or death for all who live. In the end, it matters not. I will see her face again.
Isolde was my life. Viego died when she did and the ruined king was born.
The black mist flows from me like a tide. At times, it ebbs, but now we surge forward.
I remember her sinking beneath the waters... and then... and then...
A world that would rob me of beauty is a world that deserves destruction.
Hate me if you must. Until she returns to my arms, all will be brought to ruin.
I will rip her from the jaws of death. Fate cannot stop me. Nothing can.
A crown lost long ago, reborn in unlife, ripped away from his only love.
It hurts, my heart. It hurts so much.
I want precious little, yet I am forced to kill for it.
I will take, and take, until there is nothing left but her.
The Shadow Isles are just the beginning.
The mist is my great unending sadness.
Her eyes were portraits of a world without my cruelty.
What is lost is never lost to me.
This mist has but one cure... and I will find her.
And so it was that love was the gravest sin of all.
It is such a small and fragile thing, love.
There is no salvation from the dark, for the dark is me.
Isolde is gone. Yet I remain.
Soon, this long cruel night will end. But not yet.
I am already a monster suited for the horrors I must inflict.
The world denied my happiness. Now, all will die.
My forces scour the world. Nothing will escape.
We were beautiful once.
The curve of her lips, the softness of her smile.
She was the star that lit my path. Without her... darkness.
What is a wraith but the ravenous shadow of a man?
Stand against me. Call me villain. Die.
I feel her calling out 'Viego, save me!'
Surrender to me!
I take what is mine!
Isolde!
Where is she?!
She will reign again at my side, and I shall be ruined no more.
The mist will consume all. My victory is simply a matter of time.
I cast myself upon this broken throne awaiting her return.
The ruination cannot end. Not yet.
No. She remains in this world. I can feel it.
In a world without love, death means nothing.
I cannot hear you over the tremble in your voice.
You stand in the way of my love. A mistake.
Step aside, peasant. You are nothing compared to my queen.
Love ruins all.
