A true hunter never rests.
Their heads will adorn my wall.
Carve off a souvenir.
A fitting prize.
Nothing will escape.
Another piece for my collection.
Lesser creature.
Don't trip!
Slow down!
Easy prey.
I've found you, beast!
I see you, wretched creature!
So much bloodshed... This is my kind of place!
All these trophies... I'm gonna need a bigger den!
Monsters can be made to fear.
I seek only the strongest.
Walk the killer's path.
A true hunter never rests.
Strike when ready.
Catch their trail.
Comfort breeds weakness.
Whose head shall I take?
The scent of prey.
There is the hunter and the hunted.
Leave only a trail of bodies.
What a glorious hunt!
A fine collection.
Never return empty-handed.
I'm just getting started.
Each trophy a victory.
Spoils of the hunt.
A token of my conquests.
Remember every kill.
More prey, more prizes.
Listen...
Focus...
You've earned a good death. I've earned the kill.
You have a warrior's heart. I think I'll take it.
Let's fight!
Come on!
Tonight, we hunt!
