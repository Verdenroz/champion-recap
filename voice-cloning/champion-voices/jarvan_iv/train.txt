Who dares defy my will?
Topple their forces!
I love a challenge.
Righteous retribution!
Purge the unjust.
I must... not... fail.
Awareness is the key to victory! Be sure you never let your guard dow— awwowawwoah.
Sunder any army, crumble any mountain, leap the great— owwawww... oh, my toesies.
No quarter for the wicked.
Stand with me, brothers and sisters.
Find me greater foes.
Protect the faithful.
We shall rest when we are dead!
Demacia, now and forever.
Who dares defy my will?
Demacia!
Demacia!!
Demacia! Get some!
You like my weapon? Come on over for a closer inspection!
Fetch the rest of your team... I'll wait.
By my will, this shall be finished.
