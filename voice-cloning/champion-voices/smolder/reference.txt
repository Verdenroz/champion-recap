What did I do?
What do Elder Dragons do anyway? Is your power being old?
Oh, are you one of those 'elementary' dragons?
Roar!
Ha-chah! Too fast!
Go away!
Am I doing it?
I'mnotplaying.
Oh, yeah?
You started it!
I gotcha now!
Gettin' sleepy?
Ha-haa!
My archa-memenasis!
Oho, game on!
Sizzle!
Look what I can do!
You're toast!
Fire!
You want some fire?
I don't feel so good...
Oww...!
Mommy...
Help...
Why are you wearing a crown, Mr. Airyline Sol?
Huh. Why's that armored guy smell like dragon?
Whoa! Scary ghost lady!
Wow! How'd you get so good at pretending to be people, Shyvana?
Whoa, he must be the king ofthe ghost kingdom! I've gotta tell Marinos.
Roar! Beware the dragon's power! Hehe.
Do you play games?
Hi, I'm Smolder!
Mom roars in determination.
Oh, my mom says 'hi' too.
One day, I'll be so big that, if we played hide and seek, you could hide in my mouth.
Huh, whatcha doing?
Hoho, look at me, I'mpeople!
I have no idea!
Smolder guffaws nonchalantly.
Mom growls inquisitively.
Whoa! I thought he'd be a lot tougher!
Blegh! Burning void goo.
Who's the best dragon?I'mthe best dragon!
Guess you didn't pay attention in dragon practice!
Go, Smolder~! Go, Smolder~!
Can ghosts even die?
I'm going...
Mom roars in disapproval.
Oooh, ahhh!Mwahahahahahaha, FOOLISH MORTALS!...Hey, where'd everybody go?
Shyvana! Why'd you have to be so mean?
Mom growls in disapproval.
I-Iswearit was like that when I found it...!
What a nifty pile of rocks.
Aah! Oh, no! Not our fortress! Aw, no!
Yay, it stopped!
Check it out, mom! They're, like, creature people.
Mom roars in intense disapproval.
Hey, mom, check out his crown!
Woah, you sure don't like him.
Aww, I don't like hurting the little cute ones.
Ohoho, yeah! Did you see that, mom? Ismoked 'em!
Sorry 'bout that.
I hope you weren't nice. Then I'd feel bad!
ROAR!
Their mom shoulda taught 'em not to pick fights they can't win!
If I can't eat 'em, then why do they gotta smell so good?!
Heyyy, mom... I made some new friends, uh, I'm gonna go play with them real quick!
Heyyy, mom... I made some new friends, uh, I'm gonna go play with them real quick!
I heard that the royal family of Camaroar used to offer rings to my ancestors. Ha, those things must've been humongous.
I don't take orders from anyone. But, actually, I was just gonna explore around here anyway.
My wings flap, my sneezes are flame-nados, and my super fire beam breaths are only getting stronger! No more getting treated like a hatchling!
Here he is! The most splendiferous prize ofCamaroar! Me! ...Aw, yeah! Way to go, Smolder...!
My name's Ignacarious Gigantareno Rex Le Spes Offerentis, but my human friend named me Smolder.
Why's she gotta hover over me all the time? I can take care of myself.
Mom growls in disapproval.
One time, I sneezed and burned down a whole forest. No, for real.
Humans are so weird. It's like one minute they're all small and round, and the next, they're all thin and wrinkly.
Haha,roar!
Mom growls in determination.
Mom hollers.
Whoa, you're the loudest mom in the entire world!
Mom roars in frustration.
Uh, m-maybe it's good no one else can understand her.
I miss playing dragon attack with Marinos. I wonder if his new baby will wanna play with me.
Imperial dragons are the best dragons! My mom says so.
Marinos' family is HUGE compared to just me and my mom. I know mom's mentioned some grandmother Viper lady, but I've never met her.
Isn't it so funny that, the whole time you were looking for me on those pretty islands, I was on another pretty island?
Isn't it so funny that, the whole time you were looking for me on those pretty islands, I was on another pretty island?
I'm gonna be big and strong one day. Then they'll be sorry.
I'm gonna teach my new friends all my favorite games, like finders-not-keepers. They run around and collect a bunch of shiny stuff, and I get to keep it.
Mom, it's just a story.
My best friend Marinos used to tell me all sorts of stories, like the one about the kingdom of ghosts.
'Kay, I guess she's heard it before...
Mom roars in intense disapproval.
Mom growls dispassionately.
There's so much room to run around!
Gotta stay on my claws. Like mom always says, 'Rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!'
Aw, Camaroar sounds so fun. Can we go now?
Ha, an imperial dragon does whatever he feels like doing.
Skies? Land? Flame? Haha. I was born to rule 'em all.
Everything's mine to play with.
Hey, mom? What are the fire thingies next to my ears called?
Mom growls in determination.
Oh. Okay!
Swoosh!
I smell people!
Ooh, what's over there?
Ugh, I'm so hungry I could eat a whole bunch ofgromps!
Ugh, fiiine.
Mom roars in disapproval.
Oh, no! It's a dragon! Aah, run away! Aah!
Do you see anything fun up there?
Ooh, I'll find 'em.
Mom growls in determination.
Ugh, flying is hard.
Marino says people think there's no more imperial dragons. But he never lets me prove them wrong.
Need a little help!
Heads up!
A hide-and-seek champion!
Roasted!
Everybody's invited to the barbecue!
Was thatme? Whoa!
Hoo!
Haaa!
Haa!
Hoo!
Yeeeah!
Whoa, did you seethat?!
Yeah!
Argh, next time...!
They weremean!
She's here!
Hohoho, you're in trouble!
Moooom!
Mom growls in determination.
Okay, but you promise we'll be right back.
Errands? I hate errands.
Mom growls in determination.
Oh, boy! Dinner's ready!
Aw, but I'm not done yet!
I'm- Sleepy...
Aww, Ilikeyou!
Are we best friends now?
Nice!
Mom roars attentively.
Oh, yeah, right... 'Thank you!'
Smolder yawns.
Mom screeches sternly.
Okay, okay, I'm up.
Mom roars in affirmation.
Mom, stop, you're embarrassing me!
At least I didn't end up in a tree again!
They'd better not be havingtoomuch fun without me...
(Exasperated) Finally!
Aww, I've gotta work on my landing.
This is gonna be fun!
I dreamed that I was chasing bugs and rolled down a hill, but then the bugs were a city, and, well, I squished it!

Mom roars sternly.
I want one of those!
I have no idea!
Smolder guffaws nonchalantly.
Mom growls inquisitively.
Mom says I'm not supposed to eat youâ€”but I'm too fast for her to stop me!
Well,mymom's the biggest, baddest dragon around, and she's gonnaburnyou!

Hoho!

My nose is all bleh.
Phew, that's better.
