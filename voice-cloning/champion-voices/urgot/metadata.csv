wavs/audio_0001.wav|If you can't beat them, join them
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Frank Herbert's
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Cling to hope... It is all you have.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I am Zaun's reckoning!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Hahaha... Is that crying I hear? Or are you mewling?
wavs/audio_0006.wav|No more hope.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Chaos will set you free.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|All must be tested.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|The barons are not your masters—fear is.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|This pain is a gift.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|You listen to my words, while myweaponsspeak!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I am not your enemy.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Feel this. The pain will prove useful later.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Zaun, bear witness.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Break men to break their shackles.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Your cries will give voice to chaos.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|The fortunate will be the first to fall.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Existence is torment.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Embrace your fear.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Iamthe weapon.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|You will thank me, between the screams.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|What didn't kill me, will kill you!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Steel isstronger.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|You have already lost.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|A crucible of pain!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You cannot rule what I have turned to ash!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Life favors the strong.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|The suffering is only beginning.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Another slave to pain.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I offer redemption.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|What will you do to survive?TELL ME!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|They put me in chains. They gave me my weapon.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Death will end your agony.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|You will know fear.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Pain will not betray you.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|You will fall so far.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I will lay your weakness bare.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Do not fight it. Shh...
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Do you think me so weak as to fall for your charms?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|My, my. What have they been up to in Piltover?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I must admit, I have a thing for... legs.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|The hand of Noxus can be cut off; ask yourmaster.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|A pale imitation.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|My replacement? Really, now?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|This one... has potential.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|The child is learning.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|If you feed on pain, I welcome you to the feast.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Give me a reason to fear you.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You defeated Noxus. For that, I will make this quick.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I heard you like to give hugs.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|The city calls for chaos. She is but the first to answer.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I hope your father begged when Swain betrayed him.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Where do your loyalties lie? I will bury you next to them.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|This is not your land, and that lizard doesn't even like you.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Noxus is lost.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Piltover is a parasite.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Let the rage carry you... into my chains.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You respect strength. Good. Then you understand.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Noxus failed you... when it did not punish your betrayal!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Caught between two worlds? I'll drag you out of both.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|You've felt my pain. Now feel yours.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I will not kneel to a deceiver.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Your coat isn't even as nice as mine.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Compared to what you do, this is merciful.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Don't be greedy, there's enough pain for all of us.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Beneath those gloves... you are broken.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|The only thing you enforce is limitations.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|You can die beside them, but you will never be a Demacian.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You were made to be a weapon. Embrace it.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|This... is going to be messy.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|There is always another trial.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Think of all that you have survived.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Zaun welcomed me with open arms... and a knife to my back.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|But I still have so much to kill for.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|What exactly have I been killing...?
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Hold on... There's something... Ahhh, that's better.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I was stronger.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Are none of you worthy?!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|A pathetic display.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Do not waste my time.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Zaun, let this be your warning.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|You disappoint me.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Sacrificed for the cause.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|One falls, as many rise.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|You admit your weakness.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|At last, you know your place.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Raise them up on chains. Zaun will see my message.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Now, to destroy everything you love.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Enjoy this final moment... before your trial begins.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Controlling them will be simple... with my hand around their throats.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|It is time... for them to die.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|If they could only comprehend the truth of the Dredge... I wouldn't need to drive it into their skulls.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|We will rise from the rubble, stronger than before.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Few will endure the chaos to come.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Your fear, given chemtech and flesh.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Their future is carved into my flesh.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Only those who survive this city deserve it.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The Dark Knight Rises
wavs/audio_0099.wav|This is the only truth that matters: a weapon aimed at your head.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Strength... will be tested.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Where will they run when the whole city burns?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|There is no coming back.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Who among you are worthy?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I answer tono one. No matter how loudly they beg.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I want to see their faces when I tear their hope away.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I am the very definition of a self-made man.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I was not reborn in the depths. I merely refused to die.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I am stronger than man, stronger than machine, I am an idea.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|If they do not stop me, they will die. It is just that simple.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Screams follow in my wake.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|A new order... chaos.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|A city, choking in the Chem-barons' grasp.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|The weak are condemned.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Zaun will be redeemed... in the flames.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Carnage—as intoxicating as chemtech.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Endless misery, mhm... Wonderful.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Such marvels, built of pain.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Their cries are calling me home.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Cast into a pit of despair, I climbed out on the corpses.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Power. Fear. These are my weapons.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I will guide you to a new age, born of destruction.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Think how much stronger they'll be... if they live.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Tear their weakness away, andnothingis left!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Brutality. I approve.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Come back when you are stronger.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Run, if you must.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|You try to flee, not realizing... you are in chains.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Do you feel... safer?
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Strength comes from suffering.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|You only prolong your agony.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Was the pain too much?
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Did you think that would save you?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Unworthy.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|The weakdeserveto die!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|If only you were stronger.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Mortal Kombat
wavs/audio_0137.wav|You only have yourself to blame.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Freed by chains.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|No one will shed a tear. That is why you cry.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|What kind of monster would kill a child? Oh... right.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|The world does not need gods.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Stars fall the hardest.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Say 'Shurima'one more time!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|You'd think a nation of pirates would never bow.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|I considered you my equal. I was wrong.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I am all the weapon I need.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|The walls come tumbling down.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|What'll be born of your suffering?
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Noxus already had an executioner.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Your friends are the chain you could not break.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Frankly, I never found you attractive.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Slippery, aren't you?
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Cold as death.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Hmph. I thought you would be bigger.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Demacia... Indeed!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I don't know what he said, but he screamed it.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Of all the people to fail a test.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Balance gives way, to chaos.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Make way for Jarvan the Fifth!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|You chose... the wrong weapon.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|And Piltover rejoices.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|I never saw the beauty in death... until now.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|A father should be with hisdaughter.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|The storm... breaks.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|That thing spit in my eye.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Every one of you, as dead as the last.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|I had my fill of stones in the Dredge.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|You finally live up to your name.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|The stars are too far away to help you.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Power must be earned.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Every empire falls.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Friends to the end, how inspiring.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|As the bones foretold: a quiet,peacefuldeath!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|You died the moment you let a god control you.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Without Zaun, you arenothing!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|You were the hero. Now you're dead.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|I'm sure Valor will swoop down any second...
wavs/audio_0178.wav|A resplendent death; feathers and fur.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Broken, again.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Don't worry, I'll take care of those runes.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|So much anger.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|I'll finish what the Mist started.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|The sands will bury you all.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Aw, Sion. You were already dead to me.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Not. Viable.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|No music. Only silence.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|You've betrayed me for the last time!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|You knew this day would come!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|You were never in control.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Obedient to the end.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|You bargained away your freedom... for a frozen stick.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|I liked the old you more.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Did you say bow, or bow?
wavs/audio_0194.wav|In the depths, we are all animals.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Evil needs a new master.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|You could have been so much more.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Evolution gives way to revolution.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Blood in, blood out.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|The Void may learn, but not quickly enough.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Birds of a feather, die together.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|[Let's]Make America Great Again
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Your strength has saved you.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|There are more trials to come.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Impressive.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Cut their weakness out!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Accept what you have always known.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|The end is near.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Keep struggling. Maybe you can save your hat.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Scream louder, I want Swain to hear it!
wavs/audio_0210.wav|A duel to your death.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Think of all the innocent barrels I'm saving.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Let me introduce you to death.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Tranquility awaits.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|She'llnever escape, and neither will you.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Metal... meet metal.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Here, kitty, kitty...
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Your rage makes you... predictable.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Bringing the beast to heel.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|Gather your strength. Soon, I will take it.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|You die when I choose.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Zaun calls for its headsman.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Our rise cannot be stopped.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Echoing from the depths.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|No, please, tell me about your religion.
wavs/audio_0225.wav|That is what I want you to think.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Death. Could not. Break me.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Pain is the act of becoming.
wavs/audio_0228.wav|What is strength if you do not use it?
wavs/audio_0229.wav|It is not violence. It is... philosophy.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|You cannot know strength... Until you are broken.
