Ashe_Original_Attack_10.wav|ashe|en|This is my warning to you…!
Ashe_Original_Attack_12.wav|ashe|en|Fate will treat you coldly!
Ashe_Original_Attack_13.wav|ashe|en|Never. Lose. Focus!
Ashe_Original_Attack_14.wav|ashe|en|I do my best work from afar.
Ashe_Original_Attack_15.wav|ashe|en|Flee from the cold.
Ashe_Original_Attack_16.wav|ashe|en|You face true ice—you face death.
Ashe_Original_Attack_17.wav|ashe|en|Fate did not choose you.
Ashe_Original_Attack_18.wav|ashe|en|As ice shatters, so shall you!
Ashe_Original_Attack_19.wav|ashe|en|My arrows fly true.
Ashe_Original_Attack_2.wav|ashe|en|I was raised for war! I am Iceborn.
Ashe_Original_Attack_3.wav|ashe|en|My aim is steady.
Ashe_Original_Attack_4.wav|ashe|en|Hmph, the cold does not forgive.
Ashe_Original_Attack_5.wav|ashe|en|You would challenge an Iceborn?
Ashe_Original_Attack_6.wav|ashe|en|I greet you; as a Freljordian!
Ashe_Original_Attack_7.wav|ashe|en|'Thunk'!
Ashe_Original_Attack_8.wav|ashe|en|My mercy has limits!

Ashe_Original_E_3.wav|ashe|en|Anivia, guide us!
Ashe_Original_E_4.wav|ashe|en|Spirit, reveal our way.
Ashe_Original_E_5.wav|ashe|en|Lead our way.
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterAnivia.wav|ashe|en|Anivia, how often have I sought your guidance? And how like a god to betray a mortal's trust!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterBraum_0.wav|ashe|en|Braum! What are you doing over there?! Are you drunk?
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterBraum_1.wav|ashe|en|So, Braum. No shirt, huh? And I don't have pants. Yay, Freljord.
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterBraum_2.wav|ashe|en|Braum, we are a winter people from a frozen land. So we must… pop it, pop it!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterGragas.wav|ashe|en|Gragas! Are you blind?! You're on the wrong side…again!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterLissandra.wav|ashe|en|Lissandra, the fate of our people hangs in the balance, and you betray me?!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterSejuani_0.wav|ashe|en|You named me battlesister and kin, Sejuani.Do not make me fight you!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterSejuani_1.wav|ashe|en|So, which one is the pig? Kidding!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterTrundle.wav|ashe|en|Trolls are the enemy of mankind! You will die like a beast!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterTryndamere_0.wav|ashe|en|Tryndamere…? What have you become?!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterTryndamere_1.wav|ashe|en|How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow.
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterUdyr.wav|ashe|en|Shaman, I am no enemy of the old gods or Sejuani! Must we fight?
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounterVolibear.wav|ashe|en|Ancient one,go! The Volibear is honored here, but unwanted!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|ashe|en|Prepare yourself, you face an Iceborn!
Ashe_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|ashe|en|I am Ashe, Daughter ofGrena! Warmother of the Avarosans!

Ashe_Original_KillSejuani.wav|ashe|en|Sejuani…! Goodbye, sister.
Ashe_Original_KillTrundle.wav|ashe|en|Die, troll. My tribe will destroy your foul race!
Ashe_Original_KillTryndamere.wav|ashe|en|Tryndamere, my love. I always suspected this would be our end.
Ashe_Original_KillUdyr.wav|ashe|en|May the voices quiet for you, shaman.
Ashe_Original_KillVolibear.wav|ashe|en|Man no longer needs the Volibear. Return, and I will slay you again.
Ashe_Original_Kill_0.wav|ashe|en|You fought an Iceborn! Death was the only possible outcome.
Ashe_Original_Kill_1.wav|ashe|en|Heh. Svaag, I have seen babies fight better than you!
Ashe_Original_Kill_10.wav|ashe|en|Right between the eyes.
Ashe_Original_Kill_11.wav|ashe|en|Are all southerners so weak?
Ashe_Original_Kill_2.wav|ashe|en|They fought an Iceborn, they died.
Ashe_Original_Kill_3.wav|ashe|en|I only needed one shot.
Ashe_Original_Kill_4.wav|ashe|en|Svaag, warmblood, was that your best? I killed you without trying.
Ashe_Original_Kill_5.wav|ashe|en|No one escapes my aim.
Ashe_Original_Kill_6.wav|ashe|en|No one escapes my bow.
Ashe_Original_Kill_7.wav|ashe|en|No sagas will mark their passing.
Ashe_Original_Kill_8.wav|ashe|en|Mark where they died; that was as close as they got.
Ashe_Original_Kill_9.wav|ashe|en|No one escapes winter.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|ashe|en|My mother loved me. She fought and died trying to give me a better life. So I fight, and will die fighting, to give all Avarosans a better life.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|ashe|en|PraiseOrnn, the Firebringer. I ask for your wisdom, First Builder and Forgelord.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_10.wav|ashe|en|I loved my mother. I loved my battlesister. I love my people. It is because of this love that I fight.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_11.wav|ashe|en|I dream of the day after the tribes are unified. I dream of no longer needing to lead.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_12.wav|ashe|en|In the North, a great chieftain is called 'Warmother.' Who but a mother has the right to risk lives in war?
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_13.wav|ashe|en|Clan or tribe, they will join us. This is the will of Avarosa.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_14.wav|ashe|en|We praise the leader who unifies, forgetting it is only the unity that matters.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_15.wav|ashe|en|The goddess Avarosa… I say I hear her voice. But I hear only my mother's; and mourn her passing.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_16.wav|ashe|en|PraiseAnivia, the Frostbringer. Let us feel the coming of change. Grant us the freedom to travel in safety.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_17.wav|ashe|en|PraiseKindred, the Two Hunters. Pray we see death's approach, so we may complete our labors and die with our eyes open.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_18.wav|ashe|en|Hmph, 'destiny'. I have always hated that word. It is a wyrm that ruins lives and murders innocence. It is a deceiver and bringer of woe.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_19.wav|ashe|en|What is it to lead? It is to lie. It is to preach caution even when you are elated. It is to give hope even when you feel none.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|ashe|en|Avarosan is the tribe of many, because all Freljordians are one people.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_20.wav|ashe|en|Avarosa speaks one truth, as all gods must. She is our dream of unity.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_21.wav|ashe|en|It is not the goddess Avarosa's glory I wish to recapture; it is our people's.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|ashe|en|I have heard no better words than 'The strong must try the impossible.' This is the oath I must fulfill.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|ashe|en|The Three Sisters are a myth that has strangled our people. It is a tale of failure.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|ashe|en|I am a Warmother—a chieftain—only because no one else will do what must be done.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|ashe|en|Bless us,Ildhaurg, Warden of Sacrifice. Protect myhusband. Protect my people. If my death pleases you, let it sustain my tribe.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|ashe|en|You do not aim a bow at the target, you fire knowing where the target will be. This, is vision.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_8.wav|ashe|en|Blessed1Three Sisters. Give me strength to endure what I must. Give me courage to fight who I must. Give me knowledge to see the truth.
Ashe_Original_MoveLong_9.wav|ashe|en|Glory to theVolibear, the Thousand-Pierced Beast. Give my people the resilience of your wilderness and the fury of your storm.
Ashe_Original_Move_0.wav|ashe|en|I am a Warmother. I have given oaths to few. I have taken oaths from many.
Ashe_Original_Move_1.wav|ashe|en|My tribe will bring peace to the North! The South should fear us.
Ashe_Original_Move_10.wav|ashe|en|They think me cold. I have seen things the Southerners cannot imagine.
Ashe_Original_Move_11.wav|ashe|en|I will show them the power of anIceborn.
Ashe_Original_Move_12.wav|ashe|en|The Freljord shall unite!
Ashe_Original_Move_13.wav|ashe|en|Together, we are strong. Together, we are…Avarosan.
Ashe_Original_Move_14.wav|ashe|en|Gods and spirits guide us. But our lives… are our own.
Ashe_Original_Move_15.wav|ashe|en|I am Freljordian. Family, tribe, they are all.
Ashe_Original_Move_16.wav|ashe|en|The day our tribes are one, the world will tremble.
Ashe_Original_Move_17.wav|ashe|en|Avarosa guide me.
Ashe_Original_Move_18.wav|ashe|en|Today, the fate of our people hangs in the balance.
Ashe_Original_Move_19.wav|ashe|en|Hearthbound and Iceborn; Spirit Walker and Fireborn; all Freljordians are my kin.
Ashe_Original_Move_2.wav|ashe|en|Seek peace, but bring the tools of war.
Ashe_Original_Move_20.wav|ashe|en|Do not confuse mercy for weakness.
Ashe_Original_Move_21.wav|ashe|en|I will not allow us to be divided. We are one.
Ashe_Original_Move_22.wav|ashe|en|No fate is written, except by us.
Ashe_Original_Move_23.wav|ashe|en|I was born into poverty—all Freljordians are.
Ashe_Original_Move_24.wav|ashe|en|Peace requires a steady hand.
Ashe_Original_Move_25.wav|ashe|en|We are all kin of kin. Blood, of blood.
Ashe_Original_Move_26.wav|ashe|en|A battle worthy of the Freljord.
Ashe_Original_Move_27.wav|ashe|en|When I say Avarosa, I hear my mother, and her dreams…
Ashe_Original_Move_28.wav|ashe|en|Swiftly now!
Ashe_Original_Move_29.wav|ashe|en|We will unite theFreljord.
Ashe_Original_Move_3.wav|ashe|en|I dream of a nation for my people.
Ashe_Original_Move_30.wav|ashe|en|Move quickly, position well, and the battle is won before blood is drawn.
Ashe_Original_Move_31.wav|ashe|en|My people know only cold and hardship… I will teach them peace.
Ashe_Original_Move_32.wav|ashe|en|The bow is my will given form: I am it; it is me.
Ashe_Original_Move_33.wav|ashe|en|Lead the target.
Ashe_Original_Move_34.wav|ashe|en|What is goodness but trying to do better than your forebears?
Ashe_Original_Move_4.wav|ashe|en|There will be peace in the Freljord. Iwillforge it.
Ashe_Original_Move_5.wav|ashe|en|I do not seek the throne of Avarosa.
Ashe_Original_Move_6.wav|ashe|en|We must press on!
Ashe_Original_Move_7.wav|ashe|en|I hold a bow ofTrue Ice. I hold my heart.
Ashe_Original_Move_8.wav|ashe|en|Let's see how close they can get.
Ashe_Original_Move_9.wav|ashe|en|The ice is not pain, it is surrender.
Ashe_Original_Q_0.wav|ashe|en|Thisis the fury of an Iceborn!
Ashe_Original_Q_1.wav|ashe|en|Faster than my arrows? I think not!
Ashe_Original_Q_2.wav|ashe|en|Rain death!
Ashe_Original_Q_3.wav|ashe|en|Strike quickly!
Ashe_Original_Q_4.wav|ashe|en|Stand together!
Ashe_Original_R_0.wav|ashe|en|I am the bow!
Ashe_Original_Taunt_0.wav|ashe|en|This is the latest in Freljordian fashion. They call it a… skirt.
Ashe_Original_Taunt_1.wav|ashe|en|Take a good look; it's the last you'll get.
Ashe_Original_Taunt_2.wav|ashe|en|This outfit makes total sense, just look closer and think about it… less.
Ashe_Original_W_0.wav|ashe|en|Make it count!
Ashe_Original_W_1.wav|ashe|en|Away!
Ashe_Original_W_2.wav|ashe|en|Arrows, fly!
Ashe_Original_W_3.wav|ashe|en|Can't miss!
Ashe_Original_W_4.wav|ashe|en|Let fly!
Ashe_Original_W_5.wav|ashe|en|I won't miss!
