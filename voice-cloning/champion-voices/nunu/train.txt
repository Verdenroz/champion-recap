It's okay, we'll play later.
I really... don't likemonsters!
Songs aren't usually this... scary.
Don't close your eyes, Willump! We gotta face this!
Brambleback! It was you all along! Well, your evil deeds end here!
I heard what you did inKumungu, Brambleback!
Cinders in his heart. A sure sign of evil, Willump.
Willump can't stop seeing red! What did you do to him, Brambly?
The princess will never wake up, unless we can find a bramble rose.
Cloudy with a chance of dragon!
Why are there never any snow dragons? (Willump noises) Oh yeah, we can make one.
Lift me higher, Willump, so I can punch it in the nose!
A real dragon?!
One ring to rule them all.
Gah! We've been poisoned, Willump! The only cure is to kick Gromp's butt!
Think Gromp's actually a princess? (Willump noises) I'm not kissing her!
Let's Gromp it up!
The fairy's voice was coming from over here! I bet that Gromp swallowed her!
Lord Grompulus Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth, your unjust reign ends here!
Infernal? Sounds evil to me!
You think the Krugs turned all those people into stone? (Willump noises) There's only one way to find out!
If you see a Krug's shadow, that means there's gonna be an earthquake.
These Krugs don't look happy to see us... They must be up to something, Willump!
Sorry, Krugs. Willump says I gotta fight you to learn multiplicationing.
The frost troll will never leave the village if we don't get rid of the Krugs. He's scared to step on them.
You're in a mountain of trouble!
Can't be any worse than a sea serpent!
That old man in the cave asked us to kill exactly ten raptors. (Willump noises) I don't remember why.
We gotta stop the raptors before they become evil raptosaurs and try and eat the sun! (Willump noises) What? It could happen.
What a big beak you have, Mrs. Raptor. You're gonna use it to hurt people, aren't you?
Are you sure they're really raptors? Or are theyVoidmonsters in disguise? (Willump noises) Pluck their feathers, Willump!
Don't hold back, Willump! They stole this nest from those wraiths we talked to!
Stay close, Willump.
Uh-oh.
I can do this. Huh!
Beat up a bunch of tiny goobers, then you can fight the boss!
A stonesentinel! He must be guarding something... like a secret!
We will banish you from this valley, rock-skin boulder-man!
Tell us what happened to the sentries, blue guy! Or someone's gonna get hurt!
He's sucking up all the blue in the world! We gotta stop him, Willump!
Don't let them bite you, Willump, then you'll turn into a were-yeti! ...Wait, that would be awesome!
The boy who cried wolf? That's not me! I never cry.
Murk wolves, I come to fight you in the name of your archenemies! Murk CATS!
I'm gonna play a song so loud these wolves will lose their stinky breaths trying to howl over me!
The wolves are howling so much the moon can't sleep at night. Let's muzzle them, Willump.
Put some claw into it, Willump!
Meet my best friend, Willump!
Willump's not a monster!
Watch out for his beard! You can get tangled up in it.
Something tells me they don't want a hug.
I got your back, Willump! Woah! Almost fell off!
Fear the wrath of Svellsongur! (Willump noises) It's not a flute!
Let's kick bad guy butt! *laughs* 'Cause they never wear butt armor!
We'llalwayswin, 'cause we have something to fight for! (Willump noises) Not princesses! Gross!
No wonder they're so angry, they forgot to bring snowballs!
We don't wanna hurt you.
Don't make me come down there and bonk you myself!
Clawsslash! Teethchomp!
I have sworn to vanquish all kinds of bad stuff, starting with your face!
Saving the world is so muchfun!
Mess with the yeti and you get the boy!
It's not fighting if you're having fun!
If we save the Freljord, everyonehasto like us!
I don't know what 'dastardly' means, but I'm gonna punch it!
Yeah! What he said!
Evildoers beware!
I learned how to fight from a song. (Willump noises) That's not weird! (Willump noises) It's cool!
You bop and I'll boop, Willump!
Didn't anyone tell you? The bad guys never win!
And a little ofthat! Pow!
The best part of being a hero... is shouting out your catchphrase!
What you're doing is wrong!
These bad guys aren't gonna bruise themselves!
Willump! No...
Willump! Don't leave me!
Willump! I'll save you, Willump! I'll save you! I can save you. I can...
My mom said as long as I remember her, she'll always come back... like Anivia.
Our caravan used to race Anivia all across the Freljord!
Thevault door! I bet Ornn carved it! (Willump noises) What? That's not a spoiler!
Braum? I knew you were real! Will you be my dad?
I can be a hero too! I'll show everyone in theFrostguard!
I hope Lissandra's not mad. Huh, her face might freeze that way.
It's not how you die, Olaf! It's how you live! Even I know that!
Uh-oh, Willump. He's got two axes, one for each of us.
Ornn! My mom used to sing yoursongas the ashes died in the fire. It still makes me feel warm.
Sometimes fighting can teach you things... like how to forgive your brother.
Definitely not a princess.
I wanna be a barbarian when I grow up!
Believe in yourself, Tryndamere, and you won't need tocall people chickensbehind their backs.
Volibear! Uh, sorry. I mean, the Volibear. Or, uhm, Mr. The Volibear... sir...
Why did the Frostguard cross the road? 'Cause he thought he was a— (Willump noises) *yells* Whoa! You really don't like Frostguards.
Knock knock. (Willump noises) A Frostguard! (Willump noises) W- Willump! You're not supposed to smash him!
A Frostguard walks into a mead hall and— (Willump noises) Woah! Not again! (Willump noises) *chuckles* Joke's on me, huh, Willump?
Speak softly and carry a big stick.
Some say, the beast's cries can still be heard whenever you taste purple.
Am I crazy, or was that monster more afraid of me?
At first I was afraid, but then I felt... the snow became ice. What's happening, Willump?
No flowers on this one! We gotta keep looking!
But maybe it wasIvern'sfault.
Now there's nothing but ash... evil ash!
You should've just said you were angry.
And once again the village was saved, thanks to the one and onlyNunu! (Willump noises) Fine, Willump helped.
I like watching clouds, but it's even better fighting them!
They were just defending their home. Why don't the songs ever mention that?
Looks like we got... under his scales.
Dragonslayers! That's us.
More like,elderlydragon!
Apologies, m'lady. We'll find a way to un-toadify you.
Phew! I've never Gromped so hard in my life!
May the crown pass to a more worthy Croaksworth. Like Tim! Or Jerry. Or Jeff. Or, um... hm.
Fairy? Are you in there...? Whoa. Disappeared!
That was a weird cure. I hope I read the scroll right.
Spicy! ...I said 'spicy'!
Frost troll! Your feet are safe now!
We should go back to the village, Willump. Maybe the curse is lifted?
That was your mistake, Krugs. We never take evil for granite.
Willump, you didn't have to shake the earth yourself.
That's what you get for teaching numbers!
We beat up a mountain! Woah!
Salty.
I know I should be happy, but... it feels lonely, Willump.
Oh yeah, the old man's gonna make pants out of the raptors' beaks and stuff. (Willump noises) I don't know how.
Maybe now the wraiths can come home!
You say everything tastes like raptors.
Sun's still shining, guess that means our work is done.
The other kids said I had a big beak once.
High three, Willump!
Rift scuttled!
Yeah! Go back to the Void, ya crabbybutt!
No one's the boss of me! (Willump noises) I hope Lissandra didn't hear that.
You shouldn't abandon your best friends!
Next time you'll remember, it's not nice to keep secrets!
Sometimes blue is the only color in the Freljord. I remember my mom had blue eyes...
Crumble under the weight of your infamy!
I'm more of a murk-yeti-kid myself.
Uh-oh. If the moon sleeps at night, it won't shine anymore! Guesswebetter do the howling!
And though the song has ended, it echoes in our hearts!
...I'm gonna miss those pupsters, Willump.
Oh no, you bitthem, and now they're yeti-wolves!Awooo!
Playing dead is still playing, right? (Willump noises) Oh...
We didn't wanna hurt you, that's why we used snow.
Hurting people isn't fun, Willump. Is that why it's so hard to be a hero?
Ooh, one too many snowballs...
Hah... Magic tickles.
We did it, Willump!
You were gonna hurt someone with that!
Smell you later, bad guy!
Perfect timing! Must be from all the songs.
Woah!! *grunts* ...Ha.
Woah!!
Whoa!
Uh-oh, I think Lissandra's mad at me. (Willump noises) But I won't let her hurt you, Willump!
It's not a flute, Willump. It's a sword, called...Svellsongur! (Willump noises) Fine, I'll stick to snowballs...
Once upon a time, there was a yeti, and a boy. (Willump noises) But this timeIget to be the yeti!Roar!
This way to...adventure!
Uh-huh. (Willump noises) No way! (Willump noises) Woah, that's the best story my ears ever heard! (Willump noises) But... no one got hit in the face with a snowball. (Willump noises) 'Til now! Gotcha, you big galumpa!
And so they traveled, over mountains and glaciers! And this one time, there was a village full of people turned into stone! (Willump sighs.) We couldn't help them. (Willump noises) But we're gonna help everyone else!
Haha! Yippeeeee!!
Haha! Can't catch me!
Faster, Willump!
Woah, too fast! The snot just froze to my nose!
Whoa! This. Is. Awesome!
The gods are gone, the world their forge. Now flames are gone, and words our torch. Against the cold, this song I sing, a spark of my own forging! Well, technically my mom's.
A creature great, a mountain guard. A terrible monster, its own past scarred. In ruin it rages and magic swirls, but its power once saved the world. Woah, that guy sounds cool!
The witch hissed as her spell was spun. And heroes raised their voice as one, 'For glory, for freedom!' They joined the fight, but their cries were trapped in darkest ice. Lissandra taught me that one!
We've told the tales of iron forged, we've cowered at the thunder's roar, but if you sail, the sister seek. Seal Sister from the ocean speaks! Willump, I want to meet her!
The troll was fierce, his breath was cold. Not blood, but ice you would behold. To spill from wounds, the bites of steel. In flesh was hero's blade concealed! Being a hero is awesome!
Ice, wind, spray of souls. Lay of seekers, the elder toll. Locked for eons, a frozen key. The power lies insideme!
The dragon's maw opened wide, and fire bloomed deep down inside. The hero saw a flash of teeth, and... Maybe I'll tell you what happened next time, Willump.
Steel flashed as it cut through air, and web guarding the spider's lair. Eight legs, covered in claws and hair. A web of danger, life ensnared!
We're off like a dirty tunic! (Willump noises) That's what one of the elders used to say. (Willump noises) I wonder if he's alright.
Someone out there needs our help!
Keep your eyes open for treasure. Like skulls or... rusty swords! Cool!
This day keeps getting more bizonkerific!
I bet you three icicles I can fly, I just never jumped hard enough. (Willump noises)
My mom's out there somewhere. (Willump noises) I can hear her, Willump, every time I go to sleep...
Playtime'sneverover!
Ughh, old people always doom the world, so it's up to kids to save it!
They only hurt people 'cause there's something sad in their hearts? (Willump noises) Then I'm gonna knock it out!
I bet we could have fun over there.
Heroes don't need hugs. (Willump noises) Okay, they're not looking now. Bring it in, you big fursnarggle!
We gotta find out what happens next, or I can never finish our song! (Willump noises) We can't be heroes without a song.
Make way for the yeti!
Last one there's a stinky old yeti! (Willump noises) Fine... magical too...
Let's shake out some snow!
Your fur's tickling me!
It's cold. (Willump noises) I'm glad you're here, Willump.
Keep playing, Willump! No one can tell us not to! We already broke the rules with the super-megapunch!
Slow down, Willump! You're gonna cause an avalanche! BeforeIcan!
This is just like in my favorite song! Only this time, it's about us!
Rumble, tumble, and... uh, scrumble! (Willump noises) Willump loves to scrumble!
Let's count our steps! Eleventy-seven and one, eleventy-seven and two...
Don't be afraid, Willump! (Willump noises) I am not scared! (Willump noises) Maybe just a little...
I eat heroic deeds for breakfast! (Willump noises) Willump prefersKrugs, all in one gulp... (Willump noises) Ugh.
You know what would be fun, Willump? Everything! If you're there with me!
Do your battlecry, Willump! (Willump noises) *laughs* No, not that one!
Battle is the song I came to sing!
Willump knows the way! (Willump noises) He knows lots of stuff.
The only thing louder than Willump's steps is his snoring!
There's nothing to it but to do it!
I can't pronounciate your real name! (Willump noises) Well... you can't say Nunu either.
A snowball is never just a snowball, if you believe in magic!
Everyone knows heroes are brave, and they hit stuff really hard! But only I know the true secret. (Willump noises) No! Not that!
Home is that way, Willump!
It's okay to be sad sometimes, Willump. That's how you know when you're happy!
You can't give up if you're standing on a yeti! That's as up as it gets!
I bet, if we stayed really still, we become invisible! (Willump noises) I'll always see you, Willump.
Are we there, yeti? Hehehe, get it? (Willump noises) You're laughing on the inside, huh?
Let's make snow tracks!
Sometimes the world's more interesting when you close your eyes. I see... globlins! Whoa, they have warts. That's how you know they're bad guys.
Before we can save the world, first we gotta see it!
Go, team yeti!
Let's get in there and thwack some stuff!
The adventure continues!
Let's put the venture... inadventure!
If you could do anything, Willump, what would you do? (Willump noises) Scratch behind your ears?! That's not an adventure!
How many words do yetis have for 'snow'? (Willump noises) And for 'farts'? (Willump noises) I knew it!
Your steps are the rhythm! (Willump sings.) And my flute's the melody!
Nunu and Willump to the rescue!
Buckle your tunic, we're going in!
TheFreljord'sgreatest heroes on our way!
Let's bury 'em in snowballs!
Hurry, Willump! Sounds like they're in trouble!
Fear not, fellow adventurers!
We're here to lend some fists!
Yetipower!!
Secret. Hero. Handshake! Yeah!
Up high, Willump!
Best friends forever!
I missed you too, Willump!
They lived happily ever, after all!
Did we just die, Willump? (Willump noises) Let's do it again!
I didn't think you were dead! I could see you breathing!
Can't lose hope, Willump! The Freljord is counting on us!
Roaaaar!
Snowsplosion!
Boom!
Awesome!
I just realized... Snowballs don't have brakes!
Here we go!
This is gonna be the biggest snowball ever!
Gigantulossal snowball!
Every adventure is better with a friend!
