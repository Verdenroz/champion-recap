Ahh... Is this what people call 'strategy'?
Wait... you're a baron?!
Hey Nashor! You full of blood or sludge? Or both!!
Yes! New toothpicks!
I'vealwayswanted a dragonskin belt!
Mm! I love a good pair of wings.
Wow, your mouth ishuge!
Last time I licked a gromp I sneezed for days.
Herald, huh? That a title, or a name?
Gotta work on that posture, Herald—take it from me!
CanI squeeze blood from a stone...?
Hold still! Gonna sharpen my teeth.
Just one pat...!
A family-sized meal? Forme?!
I'll fight youandyour kids!
You're so cute Ihaveto eat you!
Scuttle right into my mouth!
You protect, I attack!
No blood for you, Sion!
I don't like you, Sion!
Ooh, Talon! Show me your blades!
Not sharp enough, Talon!
You smile in fear, Vlad!
Let's compare fangs, Vlad!
Well, hi!
I'll savor this.
Fight...? Fight!!
Isn't this fun?
Lookin' tasty.
Don't think—feel.
Aww, loosen up!
I wanna see you lose control!
A snack!
This makes us friends!
Stomach's rumblin'...!
Who gets first bite?
Biting's allowed!
I wasmadefor this!
You like fighting too?!
They always run!
You're afraid!
Still hungry!
Mouth... dry!
Bleed!
Tasty flesh!
Just a bite!
Sus-te-nance!
Won't stop!
But I'm not full yet...
That's not my... stomach rumbling...
Oh, Sion! You escaped too? And you're here... with me.
We fightsodifferently, Sion—you're like 'eurrghhhh', and I'm like, 'nomnomnomnomnomnomnom'. You know?
(Whispering) Talon! Is this a brand new super-secret murder-mission?
Hey Talon, uh, what's the point of sneaking up on your target if they're gonna die either way?
Soo... You uh, you want me to call you 'Vlad' or 'Dad'?
Hi! Is this the part where we break legs?
We don't have to fight! You could just... 'share' your blood!
See these wax seals on my belt? Yeah, I earnedallof them.
PREY! WEAK AND... Sorry, old habit, uhh... hi!
You're nervous. Is it the pillory? I can take it off.
Ooh, that was fun!
Let's go again!
Phew!
I'm not just a living weapon! I can do this, and this, and...this, too!
Oh, I was supposed to laugh at that! Ehe, um-- HA HA HA HA HAA!
ALL THE BLOOD IS MINE!!
Boring Sion tastes like leather!!
Oh nooo. Sion's dead? I am so sad. I'm lying!
Traitorous Talon, you chose this!!
Aw, Talon... I- I'll save your blood so they can do the hemomancy thing!
You've become lazy, Vlad!
Eugh,that'swhat you use blood for?!
I'm nippy when I'm hungry.
Killing's different now... like food I can't swallow.
Aw, dang it! Forgot toaskif I could have their blood.
Coulda used some more self-control-- Likeme!!
BLOOD! Blooood...
Stuck in my teeth!
Hands off my meal!
I WIIIN!!
A new taste!
Ahh, satisfying!
MINE! Mine...
Nom nom nom nom nom nom!
Remember. You can choose. Don't need to cut loose right away... You.Can. Choose.
Let's see! Today, I'm going to... Climb a tree, learn the Noxian anthem, kill my enemies, and... Oh! Make a baby laugh.
Okay... so, I can go that way... oh, that way, or... that way. Ugh, so many choices! How do you all get anything done?!
Whose blood are we gonna spill today! I mean... drink. No... share? Ugh, what else do you do with blood...
Ah, finally. I needed a break from the city. Don't care where I'm going, as long as I'm moving.
Noxus doesn't care if you're different, just that you're strong. And I'm strong... reeeeal strong!
What were the principles of strength again? Look the enemy in the eyes, hit them before they hit you, and be the last one standing...?
Feels like my hunger's always talking to me... I never understand what it's saying, but I know it'sneverhappy.
Books are magical! All I have to do is look at a bunch of squiggly lines and I become more powerful! Without any killing at all! Magic!
I'm not a picky eater—whether it's a splash of blood, a bloody limb, cold blood, warm blood... I'll try it all!
If sweaty animals are salty... does that mean there are sweet ones too? Ooh! Or sour?!
Today's mystery: handshakes! Why—are they testing strength or, maybe, marking each other's scents? Hmm...
People thinkwaytoo hard about fighting. Just point the strongest soldier toward the biggest enemy! Almost worked for me...
I once heard someone say they're having 'friends' for dinner And people sayI'mhungry!
When I cut loose, I feel, hear, and see everything! I can just... be.
Everybodywantsto kill and eat, but they're all too embarrassed to do it!I'mnot!
Ears have a nice mouthfeel. Very chewy.
Nature's more outta control than I am!
Argh, moving on four limbs was so much easier!
My teeth are bored.
If I can taste through my nose... why can't Ieatthrough my nose?
Food doesn't have to be blood?! Ha.
My stomach's louder than my mouth...!
Of course! Mouths water... because they're crying for food!
Is life the hunger of death...?
Hmm... When people talk about their 'first language', why isn't 'body language' an option?
It is not polite to nibble on friends!
I might be a weapon, but now onlyIwield myself!
I don't lose control—Ifreemyself from control.
Aww, my hair's fading already? And I'm fresh outta blood!
FOUND YOU!!
NO RUNNING!
Meal time!
Whoa, caneverybodydo this?!
Snack break!!
Aaaand...Stillhungry.
Wow! Dyingreallyclears up the sinuses!
Did that happen because I hadtoomuch control... or, not enough?
I did it! I failed the same way everyone else does! ...Averagely.
heartbeat
BWAAAHHH! Heh, scared ya.
Huh, never noticed how tongues just kinda... flllop around behind your teeth.
FINALLY!
IT'S TIME!
YES!!
Nice to meet you! I'm hungry. I mean... Briar!
