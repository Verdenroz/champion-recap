Renata_Glasc_Original_Assist_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|I'm sure my parents would be proud.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Assist_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|You owe me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Assist_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|Loyalty is rewarded.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Assist_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|Someday I will call upon you to do something for me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Assist_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Nothing's free. All I ask is your loyalty.

Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Watch the suit!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|High-class chemtech.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_10.wav|renata_glasc|en|I said:jump!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_11.wav|renata_glasc|en|Waste of my time.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_12.wav|renata_glasc|en|Don't hold your breath!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_13.wav|renata_glasc|en|We're downsizing.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_14.wav|renata_glasc|en|I'm busy.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Choke!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|Get a job!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|Worthless wretch!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|Die for me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Breathe deep!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_7.wav|renata_glasc|en|Filth!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_8.wav|renata_glasc|en|Your value's dropped!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Attack_9.wav|renata_glasc|en|Money talks.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Death_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Finally... I can see them again...
Renata_Glasc_Original_E_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|I'll bill you later!
Renata_Glasc_Original_E_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|Now, this is synergy.
Renata_Glasc_Original_E_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Disrupting the market!
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterCamille.wav|renata_glasc|en|Two alchemists were murdered over thirty years ago, Camille. Do you remember them?
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterEkko.wav|renata_glasc|en|How are your parents, Ekko? If only you'd let me help them.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterJanna.wav|renata_glasc|en|Where were you when we needed you most, Janna?
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterJinx.wav|renata_glasc|en|Entertaining as you are, Jinx, you're wasting both your time and your talent.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterPiltovan.wav|renata_glasc|en|I will choke your city and laugh as they suffocate, Piltovan!
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterSamira.wav|renata_glasc|en|I bankrolled your pistols' makers, Samira. Those guns are mine by right.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterSeraphine.wav|renata_glasc|en|Sing your little songs of unity while you can, traitor.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterSinged.wav|renata_glasc|en|We could have done great work together, Singed. Pity.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterSwain.wav|renata_glasc|en|Piltover will fall to me, Swain, not to Noxus.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterVi.wav|renata_glasc|en|Doesn't matter how loud you bark or how hard you bite, Vi. A lap dog's a lap dog.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterViktor.wav|renata_glasc|en|You forget whose money made you what you are, Viktor.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounterZeri.wav|renata_glasc|en|Zeri... Perhaps I might have been more like you if my parents had survived: poor and weak.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Let's not waste my time, hmm?
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|I prefer my takeovers to be hostile. Indulge me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ah, good. I can write this off as a business expense.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|Bold of you to stand against me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|If you're not working for me, you're working against me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|Do you know who I am? If you don't, you will.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|You'll come around to my side with the right incentive.
Renata_Glasc_Original_FirstEncounter_7.wav|renata_glasc|en|We don't have to be enemies. Let me change your mind.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Joke.wav|renata_glasc|en|I mean, it's one banana, Michael, what could it cost? Ten dollars?
Renata_Glasc_Original_JokeResponse.wav|renata_glasc|en|Go away, my dear. Pray for a sense of humor.
Renata_Glasc_Original_KillPenta.wav|renata_glasc|en|The work is never over, and I love my work!
Renata_Glasc_Original_KillPiltovan_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Your hextech won't save you.
Renata_Glasc_Original_KillPiltovan_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Give my parents my love, won't you?
Renata_Glasc_Original_KillZaunite.wav|renata_glasc|en|You were regrettably expendable, my dear.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|I have no regrets, but I bet somebody does.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ah, the price of progress.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|You don't deserve nice things.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|Never cross Renata Glasc!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|My profit, your loss.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|This is why all my products are five-stars.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Poor thing.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_7.wav|renata_glasc|en|It's just business.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Kill_8.wav|renata_glasc|en|Let's see hextech do that!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Laugh.wav|renata_glasc|en|Oh, I love it... Hahahahahahaha!
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ah, my favorite part of the job: product testing.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Every fashionable Piltovan owns at least one of my products. So trusting, so naive.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Work for me or work against me, it doesn't matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|Alright, I've got companies to buy and a city to crush, so let's make this quick.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|The difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. Allow me to demonstrate.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|I remember starving in the sump, a pathetic little nothing of a girl. Look at me now!
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|It's expensive to be poor. But when you're rich, they just give you things.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Piltover coos over perfumes... while Zaun struggles to breathe.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Hard work is its own reward. *Laughs* No, it's the money!
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|I gave out breathers in exchange for Zaun's loyalty. Hah, those dividends are priceless!
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|I provide people with two options: do what I want, or do what I want but with more steps.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|When my parents handed out their cures, they asked for nothing, so we had nothing. Kind, but foolish.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Money can't buy happiness? Only someonebornrich would agree with that.
Renata_Glasc_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|renata_glasc|en|I love my city. But if I had to burn down Zaun to smoke out Piltover, well...
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|My decanter is just one more pawn to push.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Progress comes at a price others aren't willing to pay.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_10.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ambition isn't greed.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_11.wav|renata_glasc|en|Piltover will suffer for its crimes against me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_12.wav|renata_glasc|en|Wealth writes the laws that governments enforce.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_13.wav|renata_glasc|en|Zaun deserves more.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_14.wav|renata_glasc|en|Who said chemtech can't be beautiful?
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_15.wav|renata_glasc|en|There's a reason I call the shots.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_16.wav|renata_glasc|en|Empires aren't built on 'enough.'
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_17.wav|renata_glasc|en|No one even thought to invest in chemtech before I did.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_18.wav|renata_glasc|en|Power can be bought, much like loyalty.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_19.wav|renata_glasc|en|Piltover doesn't deserve the Sun Gate.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|All my parents left me was my name. Now, it's worth millions.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_20.wav|renata_glasc|en|She who controls the Sun Gate controls the world!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_21.wav|renata_glasc|en|The other chem-barons fear my reach, as they should.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_22.wav|renata_glasc|en|Throw scraps to the hungry, and they thank you for the feast.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_23.wav|renata_glasc|en|Years of investing in Zaun has paid off handsomely.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|I used to have rivals, now I have business partners.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ugh, the air is so much thinner up here.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|I don't forgive debts, and I never forget them.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Most chem-barons are lackeys who failed upward.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_7.wav|renata_glasc|en|Zaun is not beneath Piltover, no matter how it may appear.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_8.wav|renata_glasc|en|I don't need to get my hands dirty. Oh, but I do enjoy it.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Move_9.wav|renata_glasc|en|Competition is for the weak. I dominate.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Q_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Move, now!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Q_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|I adore this arm!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Q_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|Out of my way!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Q_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Step aside, worm!
Renata_Glasc_Original_RRankOne_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Time to make some new business partners.
Renata_Glasc_Original_RRankOne_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Progress.
Renata_Glasc_Original_RRankOne_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ready to take control.
Renata_Glasc_Original_R_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Kill them and suffer!
Renata_Glasc_Original_R_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|You work for me now!
Renata_Glasc_Original_R_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|My latest product!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Recall_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Alright, let's go make my accountant cry!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Recall_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Is that a stain? Ugh, now I need a whole new suit!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Recall_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Ugh, I need a breather.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Recall_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|I expect to see progress when I get back.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Recall_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|The boss shouldn't have to be in the factory for the work to get done.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Respawn_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Mistakes were made.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Respawn_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|This decanter had better be indestructible, or somebody is getting fired!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Respawn_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|No! I willnotdie before Piltover falls!
Renata_Glasc_Original_Respawn_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|Time to collect what I'm owed.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Respawn_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|Blood is a big expense. Luckily, I'm rich.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Respawn_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|I'll make them forget they ever saw me stumble.
Renata_Glasc_Original_Taunt.wav|renata_glasc|en|'I'll make you kill your loved ones' is a more effective threat than any gun.
Renata_Glasc_Original_TauntResponse.wav|renata_glasc|en|Why must you be so constantly irksome?
Renata_Glasc_Original_UseItemWard_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|For the needy.
Renata_Glasc_Original_UseItemWard_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|They ought to thank me.
Renata_Glasc_Original_UseItemWard_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|A worthy investment.
Renata_Glasc_Original_UseItemWard_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|A charitable donation.
Renata_Glasc_Original_UseItemWard_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|I'm a giver.
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_0.wav|renata_glasc|en|Prove your worth!
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_1.wav|renata_glasc|en|Get the job done!
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_2.wav|renata_glasc|en|Make them pay!
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_3.wav|renata_glasc|en|You know what to do.
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_4.wav|renata_glasc|en|That's an order!
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_5.wav|renata_glasc|en|Don't make me ask again.
Renata_Glasc_Original_W_6.wav|renata_glasc|en|Sic 'em.
Renata_Glasc_Select.wav|renata_glasc|en|It's 'Miss Glasc'... if you value your life.
