wavs/audio_0001.wav|The weak fear the shadows.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|These things always prove to be a challenge.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|How tedious.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Ughh... This may take a while.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I will enjoy this, Darius.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Revenge...
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Death is inevitable.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Pain fades...
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Run, from the shadows.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You dance on the shadow's edge.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I am everywhere.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Your mistake!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Silence, then pain.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|No way out.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Fleeing won't save you!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Feel this!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|This will be quick!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|The light will not save you.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|I'm coming for you!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Shadow is not your friend.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I'm here!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Shadows touch all!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I buy, they die. Simple.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Oh yes, this is the right choice.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Are you afraid now? You should be.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Sight, a pitiful crutch for the weak.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Oh, please.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Prying eye shall perish, too.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|No escape...
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Hush...
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I am everywhere...
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Surprise!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Goodbye!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|So easy.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|That never gets old.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|I'll let you in on a secret, you will not live much longer.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|The light's your best chance, but you're still going to die.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|There are twelve ways to kill you. Sorry, thirteen. It's still thirteen.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You and Rhaast, the failed blades.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|The more they send, the more they will bury.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Your stance was weak, your tactics elementary and your execution sluggish.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Shadows and the blade proved too much.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|The fallen only make me stronger.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Strength alone is not enough.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|And that is why I am the one.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|They too will call me master.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Four. Who's next?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|That may do, for some.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Perfection is near...
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Zed says hello... and goodbye.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|It did not have to end this way, Zed.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|They should stay down.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Wrong place, wrong time.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|You will not be remembered.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Balance? Balance favors the victorious.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|So brave, so foolish, so dead.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Be thankful it's over.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Fools die and are forgotten.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Death finds all, and so quickly.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Retreat was a better option.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|You were not chosen... to live.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|There was a time to run, but you missed it.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|True believers live forever, they will die forgotten.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|The darkin is gone. Our enemies are next.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Kill the body. Build the body. Free the body.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I wield the whisper of darkness.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Every corpse a lesson, every threat a target.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|The blade of millenia exercises my will.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|This is as it was meant to be.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I bested the darkin, now the plan continues.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I was forged by the uncaring providence of war.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Zed now walks in my shadow.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|The reaping begins with purpose.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Light offers no sanctuary.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Bathing my enemies in shadow, I leave the light to the opressed.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|With this blade, I am invincible!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Kill the mind. Build the mind. Free the mind.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|My path cuts through the bodies of the unwilling.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|My greatness has been realized.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Enough for now. I will return stronger.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Not every battle is a fight.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|That only served to sharpen my focus, and my blade.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|That was not the plan.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|A lucky stab in the dark.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|They will never see us coming.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Together, Zed, we are unstoppable!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Your stance is that of a two-legged goat.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|This is the part where you run.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I live in shadow. Others need light.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|My enemies will have no place to hide.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|This trinket may prove useful here.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|He's with you, I assume?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Such a waste of time.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Sure. Why not?
wavs/audio_0095.wav|This will only dull the blade.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Well... we're here.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|The bigger they are...
wavs/audio_0098.wav|This brings me no pleasure, Shen.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Teacher and student, yes?
wavs/audio_0100.wav|This is your master? Zed?
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Set me free!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Found you!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|From the shadow comes the slaughter.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Again!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Feed me more lives!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Kill them all!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Shadows cut deep as fear!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|They're next.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Another target!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Time to reap.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Again!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|You have my undivided attention!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Never underestimate hatred.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Fear the darkened blade!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Found you!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Again!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|The blade bends to you!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Cowering in the light... how foolish!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The shadows find everyone.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Every slaughter has humble beginnings.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|They are worthy?
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Drive me into their flesh!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Good choice. Pairs nicely with wrath and fury.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Well, you know what you want...
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Aren't I enough?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|You're making me jealous.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|This will very much upset the balance.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Not my first choice, but okay.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|A match made in shadow.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|These trinkets only annoy me.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Sight... A pitiful crutch for the weak.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Darkness falls.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Yes...!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Yes...
wavs/audio_0135.wav|No escape...
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Fear this!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Here we go!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Ripped out!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Too late.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|That's one to remember!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Hush...
wavs/audio_0142.wav|This is power!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|You let me in... So foolish!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I find your will to live amusing...
wavs/audio_0145.wav|I'm holding a sentient weapon of doom, denied blood for eons! You think I'm scared of you?
wavs/audio_0146.wav|"""I can see twelve ways to kill you. Ah! Correction: thirteen. It's thirteen."
wavs/audio_0147.wav|A craftsman never blames his tools.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|I smell death... Nope, it's you. You smell... bad.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Your skills have not improved, Aatrox.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Sorry, brother. You were in my way.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Merely the first to die. There will be more.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|That was for Zed.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|You never forget your first kill... Nope, that's not right. I've already forgotten it.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Ooohhh! That felt good.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Noxian strength is a lie.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|No mercy! Right, Noxian?
wavs/audio_0157.wav|You wanted mercy? Not from me!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Where are the worthy?
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Stand back! Kayn doesn't know how deadly this thing gets!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|That's four by my count.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Shen. Consider this a debt paid to a friend.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Demon-pants had it coming.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|You taught me too well, master.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Live by the shadow, die by the shadow...
wavs/audio_0165.wav|It should not have come to this, Zed...
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Zed's final lesson? Don't be him.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Pulp Fiction
wavs/audio_0168.wav|The shadows are my realm... and your grave.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Fear is your shadow! You are cloaked in it.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Those seeking balance will find death.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Triumph is built on a foundation of death.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|That was your destiny... to die.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Every kill fuels my fury.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Death delivered with precision is true power.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|What was written in shadow, now in flesh.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Why murder one, when you can slaughter many?
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Facing me was a mistake.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Even Zed would be impressed.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|This is but a taste of my wrath.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Cowards hide, but never escape.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Death finds fools quickly.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Just like that, and the world will be yours to destroy.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Balance is weakness.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|The strong fall so quickly to my blade.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Shadows are a shallow grave.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|My potential has been realized!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|The only way to kill...
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Those who seek balance find only death.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|The reaping has begun!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|With each kill, the shadows grow deeper.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Tenacity versus fury... Fury always wins.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|These are the strong? Pathetic.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Yes! Slaughter.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Worthless foes mock my presence.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|There is fear in your grip and doubt in your heart.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|The child is gone. The killer will remain...
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Rage inside me will not be contained!
wavs/audio_0199.wav|I will survive eternity. They will die today.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|The undoing draws near.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|The true assassin kills one to save many.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Cast off the yoke of Zed's order.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|The blood of the fallen will annoint me the new master.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Stain this fetid swamp with their blood.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Oh, how I miss the smell of blood in the water.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Wait by the river long enough and the enemy dead will float by.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Oh, yeah... Let's turn this river red.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Neither time nor violence will end me.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|This is the part I like best: the anticipation. No, it's the killing.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|I am the weapon. You are a tool.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|The rage is in your hands. Let it loose!
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Zed's order shackles you. I offer freedom!
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Underestimate me at your peril.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|What does Rhaast mean anyway?
wavs/audio_0216.wav|The shadows reveal weakness.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|I have chosen you. You will serve me.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Ionians... Are they all as confident as you?
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I am no toy, Kayn.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|Kill the body.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Kill the mind.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?
wavs/audio_0223.wav|I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|I let you go and you will die.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|The focused blade cuts deepest.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|I have mastered every weapon of war. No prattling tool will prove an exception.
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Such an obsequious pupil. I will be your new master.
wavs/audio_0229.wav|You are not worthy of the power you hold.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|I see your nightmares. Do they trouble you?
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Their screams thrill me.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Target the strong. I am a weapon, not some accessory.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|What will be the final lesson?
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Whom should I obey? Master Zed, or the farm implement with delusions of grandeur?
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Their screams will echo in this place.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|There is much darkness around you... in you.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|The weak run. Stay and fight!
wavs/audio_0238.wav|The fight will continue.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|But there's still so much to kill!
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Retreat?!
wavs/audio_0241.wav|This is gonna be weird, Aatrox!
wavs/audio_0242.wav|Nothing personal, brother!
wavs/audio_0243.wav|He just won't die!
wavs/audio_0244.wav|So little! So annoying! Sohardto kill!
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Kayn failed, as will you, Zed!
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Shadows aren't enough, Zed!
wavs/audio_0247.wav|I own the dark now, Zed!
wavs/audio_0248.wav|There you are!
wavs/audio_0249.wav|Take the pain!
wavs/audio_0250.wav|Killing is so liberating!
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Wrath!
wavs/audio_0252.wav|Feel my fury!
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Cleave them to pieces!
wavs/audio_0254.wav|I want to show you something...!
wavs/audio_0255.wav|Reap what's too slow!
wavs/audio_0256.wav|Feel this!
wavs/audio_0257.wav|Wrath is mine!
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Take a look at this!
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Slash 'em up!
wavs/audio_0260.wav|Have a slice!
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Oh yeahhhhh!
wavs/audio_0262.wav|Die!
wavs/audio_0263.wav|No one escapes!
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Cut 'em down!
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Come here!
wavs/audio_0266.wav|What can I say? I like destroying things!
wavs/audio_0267.wav|I prefer the sound of flesh being torn, but oh well...
wavs/audio_0268.wav|I'd prefer to gouge out all their eyes, but this will have to do.
wavs/audio_0269.wav|Yeeesss...
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Yeeeeesss...
wavs/audio_0271.wav|Yeeeesss...
wavs/audio_0272.wav|I do like this trick!
wavs/audio_0273.wav|Yeeesss...
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Walk it off...
wavs/audio_0275.wav|Such a gracious host!
wavs/audio_0276.wav|I'm outta here!
wavs/audio_0277.wav|That'll kill ya!
wavs/audio_0278.wav|And... you're dead.
wavs/audio_0279.wav|Key to staying alive? Don't be you.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|You have two options: one, die quietly. Two, die loudly... Okay, one option really.
wavs/audio_0281.wav|Sorry, brother. You were in my way.
wavs/audio_0282.wav|And then there were four... I think.
wavs/audio_0283.wav|Oh, please. You would have done the same.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|I'm just getting started.
wavs/audio_0285.wav|Try and stop me!
wavs/audio_0286.wav|I am unstoppable!
wavs/audio_0287.wav|Yes! Yes! Yesss!
wavs/audio_0288.wav|Bringer of death! Taker of lives! Rhaast, if you're in a hurry.
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Yes! Bow before greatness!
wavs/audio_0290.wav|All have fallen before me! I am the undoing!
wavs/audio_0291.wav|So close to perfection! Who's next?
wavs/audio_0292.wav|Don't stop now! I'm so close!
wavs/audio_0293.wav|Stand back! It's only going to get messier...
wavs/audio_0294.wav|No more demon-pants.
wavs/audio_0295.wav|The Order of the Shadow is dead, just like you and Kayn.
wavs/audio_0296.wav|Dead, just like Kayn.
wavs/audio_0297.wav|All your shadows, steel, and bluster... and now look at you.
wavs/audio_0298.wav|You hear that? Neither do I. Because everyone is dead!
wavs/audio_0299.wav|No one mourns you!
wavs/audio_0300.wav|Your failure mocks this world.
wavs/audio_0301.wav|That was some good murdering!
wavs/audio_0302.wav|I pity the rest of your kind!
wavs/audio_0303.wav|Even your stain won't last a day!
wavs/audio_0304.wav|Not worthy.
wavs/audio_0305.wav|Is there no one left to kill? You're welcome...
wavs/audio_0306.wav|Pitiful. They send only fools!
wavs/audio_0307.wav|Kneel before Rhaast!
wavs/audio_0308.wav|That was all me!
wavs/audio_0309.wav|You're not special, just one of many!
wavs/audio_0310.wav|That weapon was so... confining!
wavs/audio_0311.wav|Their blood will decorate the ground, and the walls! Everything, really...
wavs/audio_0312.wav|Which to wreak first? Carnage, havoc, or mayhem? I just can't decide...
wavs/audio_0313.wav|I survived eternity. They will die today — and the next —andthe next!
wavs/audio_0314.wav|I am the undoing!
wavs/audio_0315.wav|Poor Kayn! Guess I was a bad influence after all...
wavs/audio_0316.wav|Bring on the weak, and the strong! All will die!
wavs/audio_0317.wav|The shadows have a new master!
wavs/audio_0318.wav|How I missed this!
wavs/audio_0319.wav|Kayn weeps in the abyss between oblivions... Idiot.
wavs/audio_0320.wav|Shadows? Perhaps. Order? Not so much.
wavs/audio_0321.wav|Let's go make some corpses!
wavs/audio_0322.wav|I cannot wait to infest them!
wavs/audio_0323.wav|Kayn wasted this flesh. Rhaast will not.
wavs/audio_0324.wav|My plan: wrath! Simple, messy, delicious...
wavs/audio_0325.wav|I already miss killing!
wavs/audio_0326.wav|I'd rather be unleashing wrath.
wavs/audio_0327.wav|I guess that is better than walking.
wavs/audio_0328.wav|Okay! That did not work.
wavs/audio_0329.wav|Hm. So that's what dying feels like. Good thing I'm immortal!
wavs/audio_0330.wav|Again! This time, they die!
wavs/audio_0331.wav|Varus, the three of us— um, five of us— well...together, we will lay waste to this realm!
wavs/audio_0332.wav|Yes, Varus! Let us sow chaos!
wavs/audio_0333.wav|Do not press me, Aatrox. This is my time!
wavs/audio_0334.wav|We're moving to plan B, Aatrox: you die.
wavs/audio_0335.wav|I will nevernotkill a Yordle.
wavs/audio_0336.wav|This ends badly for you I'm afraid.
wavs/audio_0337.wav|I have broken the great Kayn. You thinkyoucan defeat me?!
wavs/audio_0338.wav|Now I am pure wrath. Fear me!
wavs/audio_0339.wav|Okay... These can be useful.
wavs/audio_0340.wav|Done. Resume slaughter!
wavs/audio_0341.wav|Helpful to know who I'm murdering.
wavs/audio_0342.wav|Death and war. This will be delicious...
wavs/audio_0343.wav|We find Aatrox, and it's a party. Of murder. A murder party!
wavs/audio_0344.wav|Together, we are unstoppable, Zed!
wavs/audio_0345.wav|Your kind go no further!
wavs/audio_0346.wav|Your kind go no further!
wavs/audio_0347.wav|Yordles... Uggghhh, you sicken me.
wavs/audio_0348.wav|I was forged to destroy, and you are in my way.
wavs/audio_0349.wav|This will be quick, but still painful.
wavs/audio_0350.wav|There are a thousand ways to kill you in this moment. I'm planning the right one...
wavs/audio_0351.wav|I will take that pitiful existence you call a life from you.
wavs/audio_0352.wav|I am chosen! The Darkin stain lives no more.
wavs/audio_0353.wav|The child is gone. The killer remains.
wavs/audio_0354.wav|In death, Rhaast now serves me.
wavs/audio_0355.wav|I am now one! I am the one!
wavs/audio_0356.wav|I am the shadow of death.
wavs/audio_0357.wav|I have snuffed out the Darkin, who dares stand against me?
wavs/audio_0358.wav|The fullness of my truth stands revealed!
wavs/audio_0359.wav|Oh! These legs will take some getting used to.
wavs/audio_0360.wav|Now I own the shadows! I will unleash them upon this wretched place!
wavs/audio_0361.wav|Oh, the wrath I will unleash!
wavs/audio_0362.wav|Destruction! Wrath! Fury! As it was meant to be.
wavs/audio_0363.wav|It's all Rhaast now!
wavs/audio_0364.wav|Poor Kayn. All those plans for naught.
wavs/audio_0365.wav|Goodbye, Kayn! Reaping will commence... now!
