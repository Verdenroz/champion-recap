How befuddling!
I theorize... your defeat!
Testing in progress!
Stand back! I am about to do... science!
Working as intended!
Eureka!
This will put a wrench in their plans!
You are poorly designed for this!
Eureka!!
Exceeding turret output capacity!
This calls for a prototype!
What a reaction!
Stop that! You will damage my turrets!
I've applied the formula for success!
I require my adjustable reverse-ratcheting magnetic box wrench!
This behaviour is highly inefficient!
Mind your vectors!
They'll have a few screws loose by the end of this!
Ah, the sweet smell of science!
A-haa!!
Ah, Jayce. Mind if I borrow some of your 'hexpertise'?
I don't agree with your methods, but by golly, do you get results!
Groundbreaking hextech innovation employed in the service... of punching.
If you seek to replace all humans, there will be no one left to appreciate your work.
Would you mind taking your hexplosives elsewhere?
Have you considered making quieter hexplosives?
Your hexplosives are disturbing my research.
Why do chemists call helium, curium, and barium 'the medical elements'? Because, if you can't 'helium' or 'curium', you 'barium'! Hm hm!
There are three key ingredients to invention: excessive imagination, good old fashioned stick-to-it-iveness, and a rocking good hairstyle!
Why do people say 'you can't trust atoms'? Because they 'make up everything'! Hehe!
How befuddling!
Order, entropy; a never ending cycle. Or is it?
Hmm... let me fix that.
Hmm... very interesting!
Order, entropy; a never-ending cycle.
Aha!
Did I leave the Tridyminiumobulator on?
Just as I hypothesized!
I do love a good conundrum.
The cosine of U-root, divided by...
I could do that better.
What an uncommon denominator!
Every problem solved is another revealed.
I concur!
Goggles on!
Yes, yes, hurry, I have important work to get back to!
Wonderfully efficient!
Bymycalculations...
Back to the drawing board!
I put the scheme in schematic!
Fascinating, isn't it?
Brain over brawn!
Too many variables
One step closer to greater understanding!
Hmm, it's smaller than the diagram.
Rise, my creation!
It's gone mad!
A-ha!
Aghnn... Dut-dut... What's that, ergh-... Come on. Enngh... ?! WAAAAAaaa—
I would challenge you to a battle of wits, but I see you are unarmed!
Don't worry, you can learn so much from failure.
Perhaps I should trymorerockets!
No, notallthe rockets!
Indeed, a wise choice.
