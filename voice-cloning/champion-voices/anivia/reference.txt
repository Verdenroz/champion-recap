I shall endure.
The cycle closes.
I am the snow, wind, and ice.
Find peace.
I bring the storm.
The Freljord awakens.
A great darkness approaches.
Life passes so swiftly.
Do not tempt the blizzard.
I shall endure.
I will not forsake my home.
Laying an egg isn't as easy as it looks.
The chicken or the egg? Actually I came first.
Forever watchful.
Think beyond one lifetime.
Winter wind, guide me.
We are all connected.
Let's soar.
A thousand lives will I give for the Freljord.
I will be reborn.
I am neither the first, nor the last.
I have felt this corruption before.
Take time to reflect.
Something ancient stirs.
What change will this wind bring?
Meaning, in every snowflake.
I dream of eras past.
So young, so na√Øve!
Poor creatures, so confined by a single life!
On my wings.
