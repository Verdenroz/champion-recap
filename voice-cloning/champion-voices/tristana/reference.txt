Let me get in there!
Show 'em what you can do!
Justtryto get between us!
Light a fire under 'em.
Who wants to lose some eyebrows?
He likes his food well done.
Well, you made him angry!
Riggle says hi.
Don't mind us!
You're looking mighty flammable right now.
Save it for the bad guys!
This is no time for molting!
Hold on to your harness!
I could stop him... but I won't.
Roast 'em!
Beware of dragon.
Wanna see a fireball?
The fire means he likes you.
Let's have some fun.
This is a dragon-'hello'!
Fire solves most problems.
Dragons are just cheating.
He views flame-retardant as a challenge!
Uh... don't lick this.
Just what you need, a taste for blood...
We'll see if they can hurt us now!
It's not that I think we're gonna die or anything...
This'll look out for both of us.
Yep, I feel a bit safer too.
Don't mess withthisdragon.
I think you're gonna like this.
Is it just me or did you get scarier?
Fire beats armor.
Last Whis- Yeah, good, good whisper.
No such thing as 'dragon-resistant'!
Good luck controllingthisdragon...!
Like you weren't squirmy enough already.
Don't worry, I'll keep you out of trouble!
I'll bet you like this cape, don't ya?
Finally, clothing that'ssupposedto burn!
...Riggle-approved!
Burn!
Need some fire?
Get that one!
Smoke 'em out!
Isn't fire just the best?
Pretty coolbear! Have you seen my dragon?
Extra crispy, coming right up!
Oh, look! Chicken flambÃ©!
Uh... Have you and Riggle already met?
How about a little fire, scarecrow?
Cool eagle! What does it breathe, air?
Who's got the flamespitter now?
We make a pretty great pair, don't we, Rumble? Just me, and this dragon.
Yep, her name's Shyvana... I think she's confused.
Trick? Roll over! ...Eeeevery time.
Ready? Aim! ...Not at me!
Riggle! Speak! Close enough.
Ready? Play dead! Good...
He doesn't like towers.
Demolition dragon!
Take it down, Riggle!
Get cooked.
That was fast.
Ouch.
I was never worried!
You weretotallyscared.
Just how much bigger are you gonna get?
He's just going through a phase! ...I think.
Who's a good Riggle? That's right, you are.
Be good, and I'll let you burn down a building or two.
I've got adragonand I'm not afraid to use him!
Ouch! Watch the horns... and the teeth- and the tail!
Not the biggest dragonâ€”but the best!
Aw, look at your little arms!
You need a bath...
When you get bigger, you're carrying me.
Arealldragons this heavy?
We aresostarting obedience training.
Is there anything youdon'teat?
Keep dreaming, buddy.
Hey! No chewing on me.
Someone's on their best behavior!
Did you get into the sugar again?!
I broke you out of that egg and I can stuff you back in!
I'll scratch your tummy later!
When do dragons start flying?
I know, I'm going...
We'll eat later, stop pouting.
This is so not the time!
You really are a handful...
We're in this together, Riggle.
Let's find you a snack.
Do I know how to accessorize?
It's scary what comes out of you...
Tell me you don't have fleas...!
Where to next?
...I really hope that was your stomach.
You're stuck with me now!
Why are you slimy...?
Now we're cooking!
Warmup time!
Fireball!
Whoosh.
Later.
Now!
No petting!
Mydragon!
Keep your distance.
He's got space issues...
Here you go! Hup. Hup! Hup!
Time for a little snack break! Hup! Hup! Hup.
Alright, you deserve it! Hup! Hup. Hup!
That... wasn't exactly how that was supposed to go.
Don't look at me like that; it seemed like a good idea at the time!
And... What did we learn?
Not a word.
I think we got their attention.
Feeling a little nervous?
Not a great time to be you right now!
My dragonwilleat you!
You're playing with fire now!
Watch my back.
I'll keep you safe.
Stay alert!
Riggle territory.
Whoa!
Whoa, who-oa!
Fly 'n' fry!
Raining fire!
From the sky!
Gotta fly!
Up!
Liftoff!
Whoa...!
Who-hoa!
Look out!
Here we are!
Eek!
Uh-oh!
Yikes!
Miss us?
Got 'em!
Dragon up-close!
Met my dragon?
Dragon snipe!
Boomersays hi.
Things are heating up!
Check the kick on this sucker!
Let's get in range.
Ready, aim, fire!
Light 'em up!
Engaging!
I got ya covered!
Nothing a little gunpowder won't fix!
We've got this!
Watch this.
They joined the wrong army.
Leave it to me!
Direct hit!
War stories don't write themselves.
I can eyeball it!
I'm going in!
Last one in's on latrine duty!
I got this one!
Woo!
Woh!
Does this make me royalty?
Sweet! Kinda gross, but sweet!
It can keep the bloodâ€”I'm thirsty for action.
Some people like backup plans. I like 'charge in' plans!
All the risk and none of the consequences? I'm sold!
Time to live dangerously.
If there's a sword for making things explode, this is it.
Infinity anything is pretty awesome!
Cannons versus armor; cannons win.
I don't take cover. I take cover-out.
It won't be so much a whisper as a deafening explosion!
No slowing me down now!
Perfect for cutting loose.
Nets, snares, vines: meet your worst nightmare.
Time to fill up my dance card!
Oh,thatlooks cool!
Ooh, I like the look of this baby!
Let's see if this makes it through the first explosion.
Can't wait to try this out!
I'm gonna need the extended warranty...
Do you sell earplugs too?
Is this blastproof?
ðŸŽµ Let 'em come by land, by sea or air! Send 'em running home when the Bandle Gunners blare! ðŸŽµ
ðŸŽµ Bandle Gunners, what'd you see? Sir, just smoke and victory! ðŸŽµ
ðŸŽµ One stump high and ten stumps tall! Bandle Gunners show 'em all! ðŸŽµ
Mind the fuse!
Stuck 'em.
Hold this.
Tag!
Tick tock.
Ahaha, you're in trouble now.
Clock's tickin'.
Anyone ever tell you you're a little clingy?
Is that gun full-sized?
You're not the only Yordle who knows how to fly, Corki.
Try to keep up, old-timer.
Hey, specs. What's cooking?
When you find the right gun, you only need one.
Nice suit, Rumble! What d'you call it?
Eyes on the enemy, Rumble.
Um, Teemo, are these mushrooms your rations or your ammo?
Oh, Veigar! Tell me all about your diabolical plan.
Aw, Veigar! You're cute when you're angry.
Watch where you're exploding, Ziggs!
A cannonball is the best icebreaker!
This is my .357 caliber handgun...
Please allow my cannon and I to conflict-resolve.
Clean sweep.
Keep 'em coming!
You should try fanning out!
Full house!
Two-fer!
Score!
Thanks for clumping!
How's that for a Bandle City beatdown?
Bringing down the house!
Who needs a fort?
Huff, puff, boom.
You're gonna need a bigger castle.
Dropping like flies!
Hey, where'd ya go?
Hmph. Cannon fodder!
Target freaking annihilated!
Nothing like overkill!
Now you see 'em, now you don't.
Get chunked.
Splat!
Splat!
Splat.
Can't wait to tell the recruits about that one.
Any landing you can walk away from...
I should really start thinking about plan B's...
Maybe I cut that a little close... Maybe.
Need a breather...
I was never worried!
Aha, haha, ha... that was scary.
I call frontline.
Ibravelyvolunteer to charge in recklessly!
Locked, loaded, and ready to rocket!
Sometimes outnumbered; never outgunned.
Let's get this party started!
Where's the action?
You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em.
A Bandle Gunner never turns tailâ€”unless it's to taunt you.
Get in my way! I dare ya.
I dare ya to dare me.
Winners don't duck.
Easy-peasy!
I just need a point in the right direction.
I might just drop in.
If it's worth shooting once, it's probably worth shooting a lot!
Walking tall.
Let me get in there!
Wanna see the fireworks?
The code is more what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules.
Who wears a helmet?
Bring on the bad guys!
Maybe we should shootfaster.
Who wants some? You want some? Come on!
Full volley!
Double time!
Fire at will!
Don't let up!
More where that came from.
Boo!
Nope.
Air mail!
Pilot to bombardier!
Wrecking Ball
See yaaa.
Over there, buster!
Point blank is the only blank I like!
Hi there!
Hands off!
Time for some rearm and redeploy!
Back to base!
Falling back!
Back to the action!
Up and at 'em!
Gotta get back out there!
Ta-daa!
You make it easy to be unimpressed.
You think you can outshootme?
On lookout.
Eyes open.
Watchin' our backs.
Watch the brush!
Overwatch.
Look out below!
Fwooh!
Up and over!
Blast-off!
Just passin' through!
Shortcut!
Whoa!
Retreat...!
Al-most!
Eep!
Oh boy!
Can't touch this!
Splat!
Didn't see that coming, did ya?
Surprise!
Thanks for breaking my fall!
Splat.
Splat.
The Gunners
