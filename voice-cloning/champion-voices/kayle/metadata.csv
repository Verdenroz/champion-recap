wavs/audio_0003.wav|Fear the cleansing fire.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Pay for your sins!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Darkness begone!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Trial by fire!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Fire reveals truth!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I bring the light's wrath.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Be judged!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Save your excuses.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Stand and be judged!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|You deserve this.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Justice unyielding!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Avarice falls!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|You fall short!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|I will not bend!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Righteous glory!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|By divine edict!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Heretic!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Rejoice at your redemption!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Guilty!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|No sin too small.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|For virtue!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Light and glory!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|The wicked shall burn!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Burn!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I deem you lacking!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Kneel before the light!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|This is your penance!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Deceiver!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|No mercy!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|The wicked shall fall!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Why do you think I wear armor, sister?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I am not frail!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Think you're the only one?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|And you damn yourself.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|No mercy!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|No mercy!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I'll ignore that.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|How 'gracious' of you.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I didn't say 'thank you'.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Better a broken heart than ashackled soul.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Are you following me or something?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Not murder. Justice.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|What had to be done.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Hmph. You never had any fear...
wavs/audio_0047.wav|How beautiful your mind must be to think such things.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Today, it seems we must put our animosity aside.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Do not turn your back onme, sister!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Your sword is with me. Do you want it back?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Still playing with your little human pets, sister?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Why have we wings, sister, if not to fly?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Are Yordles small children?
wavs/audio_0054.wav|My cold heart is the reason we are alive.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|My laws have more merit than your whims ever will.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I am the light!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|No... My wings...
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I dim...
wavs/audio_0059.wav|If I... Could see my sister...
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Let loose the flame!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I bring the light's wrath!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Endure!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Fear me.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|You Demacians have lost your way.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|You seem worthy, Garen. Now prove it.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|A throne won't save you from my judgement,  .
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Lux, the complicit are the worst sinners.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Sister, have you come to defy me again?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Your power could save this world, Morgana; instead, it dooms you.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Funny... You're on my list, too.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|You may have been innocent once, Sylas... No longer.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Are you a talking animal? Tiny mortal? Why are you so soft?!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I am the consequence of your actions.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|There is no hiding from the light.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|If you were innocent, I would not be here.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Evil fears only fire! And Yordles, because, what evenarethey?
wavs/audio_0077.wav|A thief, a murderer, and a corrupt guard, all walk into my sword. The end!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|This world didnotdeserve you.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Slain by your own sword.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I am exalted!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Your guilt was clear.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Thus, the mighty fall.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Buried with your transgressions.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Here to make excuses for their darkness, sister?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I shall battle my maudlin twin once more.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Morgana is here. How I relish the opportunity to battle my dark shadow.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|My sister is here—to fall before me again, no doubt.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|With the just hand of law I enter the fray, unbound by this mortal pettiness.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|When I looked into my mother's eyes, I saw a paradise for the just and glorious. It is for that world I fight.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Grant me the strength to forge by flame, a world beyond worlds.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|In me will rise the strength of a thousands swords... The fury of a thousand flames...
wavs/audio_0092.wav|These endless mortal cycles... Cruelty begets suffering. Suffering begets cruelty... It ends with me.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The greater the evil, the greater its opposition!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Iwillbring justice to this world, no matter the cost!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I shall purge the dark within, and rise in glory!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|I shall purge this world of evil, and the fires of Justice shall vanquish the darkness!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Let me grow stronger, that I might vanquish the forces of darkness. Let me transcend mortal frailty.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Live long enough, and all lies crumble to dust!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Injustice is a festering rot; and I am its cauterizing blade.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Only those with malice in their hearts need fear the light!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Only the divine may judge.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I do not fear the holy fire. I must become it.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Mortals are blinded by their own misery.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|What is dark in me, I will illuminate.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|The righteous path begins with me.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The divine path shows no footsteps.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|A clean cut divides darkness and light.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Emotions are a weakness.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|The light of my devotion will set the world aflame.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The moment justice bends, it breaks.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|To find grace, I cannot fall.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I must feel nothing to fight injustice.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|This world was not made to last.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|To withhold justice, is a dark sin.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|On wings of fire, hope ascends.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Truth, guide my sword!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|There is right, and there is wrong. All else is rationalization.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Where there is evil, I shall go.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I took up my mother's sword, and with it, her purpose.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|If I slip, I will fall—and so I must fly.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Iwillgrow stronger...
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I fly for the glory that shines above this caustic din.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Excuses do not concern me, only actions.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Only the innocent will be spared.IfI can find any!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Celestial justice, guide my blade.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|The path to the light, is a lonely one.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|The past is for sinners. The future is for the repentant.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|The just rise above this mortal soil.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|No human is perfect... butIam not human.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|I shall purify this land, with fire if I must.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I am divine wrath.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|I cannot rest. I will not.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Would that my path be true.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I remember pain... It made me weak.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I am anointed in the fire of absolution!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|They will break against my stalwart heart!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|I am born from the flame of their sins.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I was purified in the light.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Burn all deceivers!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Wings of Immortal Flame, lift me from mortal temptation!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I am the Light and the Glory!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|My sword is named 'Virtue', and it burns eternal!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|The fallen will never rise again.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Their deeds shall be weighed on the scales of stars!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|My devotion is unbreakable!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Only the guilty need fear me.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|The just cry to the heavens. I answer.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|The law does not tolerate imperfection. I am no exception.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|To be human is to be imperfect, but I am not human!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I have given up everything for the light.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Only the just walk the path of immortal light.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|The fire that illuminates, also cleanses.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Make thyself devout, and eternal life is granted.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Justice is swift when borne on the edge of a blade!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|My flames burn only the unworthy.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|As evil grows, so shall I.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|These blades... my sanction!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|The unrighteous will burn!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Behold, the righteous flame!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|I am your salvation!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Sister!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Redemption in the light!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|The worthy survive!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I am your salvation!
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Drown in holy fire!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Redemption, in the light.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|I salute the Fallen.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|The celestial realm awaits.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|The light renews.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|They cannot kill justice.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Still copying my hairstyle, sister?
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Surrender to the light, and I will spare your soul!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Ready to be judged?
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Flame purifies.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Flame purifies.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Heal by fire.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|They shall tremble at my perfection.
