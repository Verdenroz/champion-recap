It is done.
For the Void.
Their time is short.
We demand sacrifice.
It is done.
Inevitable.
Mortality is weakness.
I think a Voidling just came out!
At once.
Without question.
It is in motion.
In due course.
Second sight ordains it.
Icathia beckons.
As was foreseen.
Do not challenge fate's will!
We are timeless.
Bow to the Void, or be consumed by it!
Come mortal, witness your demise!
