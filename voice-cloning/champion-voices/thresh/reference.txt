It's over when I say.
Lock 'em up.
Death? No... nothing that simple.
Nobody escapes.
It's over when I say.
Wretched mongrels get the leash.
Writhe, like a worm on a hook.
No one can save them.
Any last words?
Oh, yes! It's about to get much worse.
Round we go!
Screaming won't do you any good, but it's music to my ears.
There is life. There is death. And then there is me.
Come back.
Hook, line, and sinker!
Torment comes in so many flavors.
What is the worth of a soul?
Ah, the sweet tones of misery.
Relax, just... let go.
Oh, the eternity we shall spend together.
Hmm, whose mind shall we snap?
Flesh is a prison.
My house, my rules.
I own you.
Closing in...
Ever seen your soul? Would you like to?
You're falling apart. What to do with the pieces?
What delightful agony we shall inflict.
