wavs/audio_0001.wav|You would do well to die, before my ravens find you.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|The right to rule, held, in my hand.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Try to die with dignity.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|How tedious.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Strength is the only teacher.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|If you insist on dying.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|A conquered nation, is a loyal one.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|We must remind them of their place.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|You lack discipline.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|A petty squabble for pettier men.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Empire above all.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Pity stays the hand of the merciful, but not mine.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Submit.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I will not tolerate interference!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|This will be my offering.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Weak of body; weak of mind.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|This is the least of my crimes.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|The ends of war are death.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Diplomacy is a subtle art.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|And to think, they called me a 'cripple'.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Incompetence surrounds me.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|The Raven
wavs/audio_0023.wav|The Prince
wavs/audio_0024.wav|I don't know if you're the wisest being I've ever met, or a pile of mouldering blankets.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Thorns in my side, but your flower is truly something to behold.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Ah yes, Cassiopeia. I admire your commitment to... metaphor.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|It was only a matter of time, Darius. Do what you must.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|"""Your trust may be misplaced, old friend. But it is appreciated."
wavs/audio_0029.wav|All roads lead to Noxus—but all visions, to Demacia.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|You will find this delicate morsel, quite capable of fighting back.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|"""You stood by me when I was outcast, so I stood by you when you were drunk. In spite of the stench."
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Am I to seek revenge for my poor departed arm? If anything girl, you did me a favor.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|"""Do they know who killed your father, or do they still blame me?"
wavs/audio_0034.wav|If you take me, you will leave Noxus with something far worse.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|We both move pawns in a grand game. And look at that—It seems I'm winning.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|"""You see every flaw in me and you do not even blink. A bit unwise, wouldn't you say?"
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Life would be boring without surprises. You, certainly keep things... interesting.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|I suppose this makes us enemies with benefits.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|The world may fall to darkness. But Noxus, will remain.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|People often ask for a hero, when a villain is what they truly need.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|The Vastaya blood is not in my veins. It is on my hands.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|The best armor is being forgotten; and you my dear... are quite forgettable.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|There can be no balance with a hand on the scale.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Why is he still alive? Another one of Darkwill's loose ends.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|'Beware ravens'? The words of a fool who knew nothing of demons.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Your message is your power. You have learned nothing.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I own birds cleverer than you.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|I am not smiling, I am threatening to smile. It is still a threat.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I have to know who has a crush on whom.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Which one of you isBeatriceagain?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Their lives are the plunder.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|rivals
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Predictable, as always.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|We have civilized the beast.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|More than men must kneel to Noxus.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Its strength is ours.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Death comes to even the most fierce.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I almost pity the brute.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|A savage roar, silenced.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Congratulations. We've outsmarted a beast.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|You've exceeded my expectations.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Perhaps a promotion is in order. How would you like your own warband?
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I owe you a debt. ...That is not as ominous as it sounds.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|The Leviathan belongs to me!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|One less enemy within.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You were no longer useful.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|In death, you will kneel.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|This is not even my final form.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Let us end the siege.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|One less place to hide.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|What Noxus takes, it will defend.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Witness the strength of Noxus!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Stone is not strength.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|More important than heroes, are deeds.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Their defences crumble.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Let them find hope in the rubble.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Prepare, and victory is inevitable.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|A monument to our victory.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Worth its weight in lives.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|All according to plan.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|That, is one way to surrender.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The raven was a portent. Their time had come.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Victory awaits.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Another piece cleared from the board.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Death is its own prophecy.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|The sooner we kill them all, the sooner we can leave these forsaken wastes.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|No quarter. That means 'no mercy' you cretins.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|A black flag above Bilgewater. A raven's wing.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Dead men tell tales that only I can hear.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|An assassin is due at any moment. It is how I know LeBlanc cares.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I have seen this place... A vision... A battle.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|The outcome was decided when they brought an army; and I brought a demon.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|If they already call me a villain, what will they call me when I succeed?
wavs/audio_0094.wav|It is just as the spies described... A pity I had them executed.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I've heard what they call me. What a waste of their final words.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|The more they try to kill me, the more they reveal I am on the right path.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Hmph... I do so enjoy explaining things to idiots.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Destiny marches—like any man.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|There is always a choice. The truth is no exception.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|After the battle, the ravens feast.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Would they even struggle to survive, if they knew what was to come?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Never make a bargain with a demon... that you intend to keep.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I peer through the darkness others fear.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|To redraw the map, the blood of soldiers must be the ink.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|A Noxian knows who he is. And what he must do.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The old wounds ache. They are reminders.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I cannot lead if I allow fools to stumble about before me.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Is it not enough for Noxus to be strong?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|We are at war. Do not forget it.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|They are blind to the cold logic of this world.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|When their lives flash before their eyes, so do their secrets.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I suppose I should be grateful they have the decency to fear me.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|It is not the visions that haunt me—but what I do not see.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Decisions have consequences. This I know well.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|A voice whispers in the shadows. Though few can hear it.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|The shadows of our empire, are cast by a raven's wings.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|What is one more demon, when I already have so many?
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The few, for the many.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The mud on our boots will hide the bloodstains.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I could kill them all. But it would be far crueler to show them that I am right.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|A new vantage, is all the advantage I need.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Tell me again all the crimes I've committed, and I'll tell you the price of victory.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|One can read the future in battle lines, assuming one can read.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|A riddle wrapped in a mystery, hidden within us all.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|I have killed more men with words than by my own hand. Not for lack of trying.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I am not done with you yet.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Death's hand.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|What have the ravens brought me?
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Their whispers itch at the back of my mind.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Forfeit your life.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|In death, the veil is lifted.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Your soul was already mine.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|She claimed it was the Frost Queen's grave. They believed her.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|They fight the mist above the seas, never looking beneath.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|An empire, built atop centuries of murder.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|The payment for her suffering in Shurima: a black rose.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|No daughters. Only soldiers.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Creatures of darkness that grant power to their hosts? How original.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Shaped by humanity, a reflection.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|A glimpse, mere seconds into the future.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|A vault empty of relics, but filled with corpses.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|She's spurned so many suitors. A wonder they did not see why.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|They squabble as the winds howl, and the wards fade.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|His secrets died with his sculptor.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Ignorant of the very magic you carry into battle. How Demacian.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Magic spills from their land like blood from a wound.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|His blood is the only useful thing about him.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Faces fading in the flames. It was all her fault.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|The first oath. The one she made tohim.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|So he's heard the rumours:the girlwho came back.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Heasked her to do what she could not. To kill me.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|A child who had known only hate, confuses it for love.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Which is the greater tragedy, that she fell in battle, or that she fell in line?
wavs/audio_0154.wav|The truth beneath the gilding. Only war can bring profit.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|So many obsessed with the hero. Tell me of the hammer.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Her arch-rival, a tuskvore? How undignified.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|She held their hands as they died, hoping they would drag her with them.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|A king remains in the mist, and another marches.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|The echo of a soul... Only pain brings it back.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|I already knew that.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Your eloquence: seasoning for a repetitive feast.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|She feared what she could not understand: herself.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Those born of magic rarely realize its curse, until it is too late.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|A pattern, spreading... It has learnt to be alive.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|She was closer than he realized.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Suffering pools in the depths where children play.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|They flee Noxus on the roads we built!
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Leave the survivors to their officers.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Who is it we're fighting? I only see their backs.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|One more push, and they will break.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|We have the momentum.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Drive them from the battlefield!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Do not fight for conquest, fight to survive!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Are you not children of Noxus?
wavs/audio_0175.wav|The dagger is at our throats. But their hands quiver.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|They think they have won. Prove them wrong.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Every moment we do not kill them, their advantage grows.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|The advantage is ours, if we take it.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|A stalemate. How quaint.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|A truce in all but name.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Not losing is not winning either.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|The battle is yet to be decided.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|I often kill in my visions, when I close my eyes. Do not come near.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Some say the darkness stares back... because they cannot see me.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|"""Secrets whispered in the shadow... have a way of reaching my ears."
wavs/audio_0186.wav|More than what we do not understand, we fear being understood.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|The more I see, the more I realize how much remains hidden.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|It is still watching.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Am I reborn? The truth is rarely so simple.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|A minor setback; nothing more.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|They think they have won? Pathetic.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|It is there in the silence after battle. It is there in me.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|If you plan on listing my crimes, mind you do not die of asphyxiation.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Not another word!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|When you run out of insults, try steel.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I would not ask of anyone what I would not do myself.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Every day I rule, Noxus becomes a more perfect expression of my will.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|The demon is always in the details.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|There can be no unity without purpose; and there is one all men are born to.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Gathering intelligence.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|I never stop planning.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|I suppose it's easier than conquering a demon.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|A raven's eye view.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Nefa...
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Fah-la...
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Nas...
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Krah...
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Do...
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Fear the power you do not see.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|The early bird gets the worm.
