What must be done.
What must be done.
By the power of the stars.
They will go no further.
Be at peace.
They will know serenity.
Such hatred in their hearts.
Violence cannot go unanswered.

No, I'm not happy to see you. Yes, that is a horn growing out of my head.
I lend my aid.
This is my path.
For peace of mind.
Never waste a breath.
To heal and protect.
The whole world in balance.
I heed their call.
Every step, a new journey.
Gracefully.
Stars hear me!
For life!
Have hope!
Live!
Do you always fight so poorly?
I will not save you.
Let me guide you.
