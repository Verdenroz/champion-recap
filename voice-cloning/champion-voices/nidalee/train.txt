You are right to fear me!
My spear will take you down!
This is not where you belong, beast!
Youdarethreaten my tribe?
Let's see who is top of the food chain!
Run, and I'll give chase.
Hunter, or monster—my prey sees no difference.
You know how this ends!
Your death will be swift.
This is the way it must be!
My claws cut deep!
The wild calls!
No scurrying!
The chase ends.
Fresh meat!
Leave, now!
Feral strength!
I'll put you down!
My next meal!
Easy prey!
Trespasser!
No need to suffer!
Your marrow; my feast!
I strike true!
Too late to run.
I've picked up another trail!
The trespassers are next!
Ah, I can hear the wind again.
My pack needs more!
The prowl begins anew.
Every hunter knows that core strength is key!
Let me see the sky…
Guide me home… Kupakaa…
Wild-blessed!
Heart of the Pakaa!
Lifeblood!
Hunters in the sun, can miss the beasts in the shadows, K'Sante.
Claws and spears bring death; the Kindred only finish what I start!
Little firebug, our Pakiti trust you—but they are naive.
Dog beast,Iwill show you what it means to be a pack-mother!
Love takes as many shapes as you do, Neeko.
I will chase you from this land, brass-bones!
How long can you survive outside your golden palace, princess?
I sparenoKiilash, Rengar—meet me in the hunt!
Youthinkyou understand the jungle, shaman; but you will always be an outsider.
I may seem like you, Vastaya—but we are not the same.
Oho… Are you lost, little Pakiti?
How would you prefer to die: by spear, or by claw?
You are lost. Let me show you where you belong!
Leave, now! I will not warn you again.
I have defended my home from worse!
Meow… meow-meow, meow-meow-meow-meow… You got that?
Oh, hahahaha-- Can't laugh with a spear through your neck!
Young defender, rest with pride.
My spear is thetruedeath!
You wandered too far, little firebug.
Dogs?Really, Naafiri?
Neeko… My world feels empty, without you.
Never return, brass-bones.
I believe this is called a… Kebab?
I claim your bones, for my next spear!
Through heart and spine!
A skilled hunter, makes a swift kill.
A cub who thought she was full grown! Adorable.
Justice, Rengar.Blood, for blood.
Once an outsider, always an outsider, shaman.
Ohoho, you are fiercer than you think, Yuumi!
A meal for the worms.
Pakaa protect our own.
This will make a good lesson for the Pakiti.
I will eat well tonight!
They never heed my warnings!
Nothing will be wasted.
Prey hide in the sounds of the wild—listen, then strike.
Thebrass-bonesthink they can conquer the wilderness, butnaturecannot be tamed.
I am never alone. My tribe lives in my heart, and in my spear.
I delight in this silence. The quiet before thehunt.
A hunter's instincts are inherited. A hunter's skills are honed.
My mother's title came to me heavy—with Kiilashi blood. With it, I keep my family alive.
Human, beast, Vastaya… These words mean nothing to me.
My tribe calls itself 'the Pakaa'. Only foreign prey call us 'Kashdaji'.
I pay no attention to the affairs of men—until they make me their enemy.
I do not understand the nature of humans; nothing is gained by pointless slaughter.
The jungle lives in my bones. The Pakaa, in my heart.
There is no need to climb above the canopy… But I enjoy watching the stars.
I am pack-mother, sister, daughter. I have no need to be anything else!
For generations, I have seen and survived nature's many seasons.
Famine and drought kill predator and prey alike.
Our future is in our Pakiti.
Life circles on.
Clawless hands need a spear.
I take only what I need.
I will always be my mother's cub…
My quarry won't escape.
See… Listen… Focus…
Instinct guides my steps.
I do not question my two forms.
The jungle never sleeps.
I am always Nidalee.
Prowling on two legs felt strange once.
Trespassers are easy to track.
This land will be the grave of all who trespass!
Soft of paw, light of foot.
I carve my spears from poachers' bones.
I am the wild's protector.
Protecting my pack is my purpose.
I have led my tribe for generations.
My family, is my strength.
No hiding!
There you are!
Hahahaha,my prey now!
Got you!
Claw deep!
Bone cuts bone!
Yes,bleed!
That's right,run!
For the kill!
Back on two feet.
Standing strong!
Meow! …Anyway.
Tool in hand!
As I am!
The sky is pack-mother to the world: ever-faithful, and protective.
Guide me, pack-sisters, as I once guided you.
My tribe will not starve this day—I swear it!
I learned to make tools by watching villagers. Thumbs have their place.
What new tales will the outsiders spin, of their 'monstrous Kashdaji queen'?
Meow.
Pakiti to feed, and no time to lose.
Trespassers call me 'Kashdaji queen'. I will teach them myrealname.
They will soon know who prowls this land.
My quarry got lucky!
My prey still lives; butIhave not lost its scent.
I don't needthisto tear out your throat!
I don't like when prey talks back.
Stumble.
The trap is set!
Now, I wait.
Thumbs: useful!
Patience…
The wild calls. I answer.
