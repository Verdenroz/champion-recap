wavs/audio_0001.wav|Oh, I knew you was all yeller!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Dang nabbit, you're gonna get us killed!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Easy, girl, easy!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Calm down, girl!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Skaarl, I got this!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|No Skaarl, no! Bad Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Don't get your britches all rumpled!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Don't get weird on me!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Quit your worryin'!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Whoa! Whoa! Don't get excited, now!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Whoa, Skaarl, whoa!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Don't you run off on me! Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Calm down, you damn-!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|See, Skaarl? I don't need help!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I'll kick the crap outta you!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|I'll say something witty after I kill you!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I'm gonna cut you open and use your spine for a back scratcher, because it is itchy! Very itchy!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|My brain is full of weasels!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|My blood is piss and vinegar!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Now you done it!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I'm gonna reach down your throat, and turn your lungs into mittens!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You's trying my patience!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I'm through running!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Oh, you prancing bastard!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|I'm gonna make you wish you were a hallucination!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I'll kill 'em all!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Skaarl! You're missing the fun!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I hate you!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You're a cockroach, and it's half-past stomping time!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Intruder!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|My axe talks for me!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I can only express myself through violence!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|There's fixing to be two sounds: me hitting you, and---
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I ain't stopping!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|I'm just beginning to fight!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|300
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Who sent you?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Welcome to Noxus!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You thought I was done? Kled ain't never done!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You see, Skaarl? I'm doing it alone!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Come back here and fight!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|No trespassing!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Seinfeld
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I can't be reasoned with!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|You think I don't hear you laughing?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I don't like sharing!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I'll kill you!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|I'll gut you!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I am the brutal instrument of my own destiny!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|No-one tells me what to do.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Lord Colonel Major Centurion Kled don't run, no he don't!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I don't need a team to start a teamfight!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I don't need that lizard! Kled's got his own ideas.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Skaarl! Come back, buddy! Skaarl?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I know that lizard ain't talking, but I still hear him. Shut up, lizard. Shut up!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Oh, she'll see, she'll see! She'll come strolling back when I turn them interlopers into a purée.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I said I wasn't not backing off, no how!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|This world is rough. You gotta be tough or die.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I don't need you Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Yes, a sane man would run, but I ain't the running kind!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|This here land is mine!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Damnit, Skaarl! I hate walking!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Stop talking, you stupid brain badgers!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Why's all these intruders so far away?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Sure! I'll kill all of them myself!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Even if I lose, I win! Just means I get to come back and kill you later!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|First thing you learn as a Lieutenant Sergeant Commodore: rely only on yourself.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Ain't nobody gonna give you nothing. Gotta take it yourself.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Impossible ain't a Noxian word.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I didn't become a Rear Forward Brigadier Admiral from running!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I know you're listening, brain weasels! I ain't falling for it!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|This is just a victory waiting to happen!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|What was that? Run straight into the tower?
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I am Sir Admiral Major Kled, and I smell a victory potpourri!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Hey, what was that? Of course I don't need Skaarl… but he helps.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|This desert sky's gonna open up with a rain of heavenly bloodshed and glorious violence!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Folks say I got violent tendencies.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I didn't not earn the rank of Sergeant double Admiral by not running!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Ain't nobody tough as Kled! I've got gravel in my guts and a fire in my head!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I came here to… well, I don't know what I came here for, but I'm gonna defend it!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Skaarl! Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Yip yip!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Hee hee!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Get 'em!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Whoa!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Wahah!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Wowee!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Woo!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Yeehaw!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Yah!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Woo!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Get 'em, Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Ha-ha!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Hyaah!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Drinking from battle? What kind of dumb crap is that?
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Telling people you're a god? Hell, you're barely a paring knife.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Something caught in your throat? 'cause you sound desperate!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|You know, I like you, brother. As much as I can like a lily-livered jungle-sniffer.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Watch your stepping! That's my land you're gallivanting on!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|You sure you're Noxian? You look a little Ionian to me.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Don't mess with Noxus, brother.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|You may be from Noxus, but you ain't Noxian.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I got a joke too! It's called me kicking your teeth in!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|So, that's what considered funny in the city, huh?
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Real funny! Knew a funny guy in the Drekan Campaign—took a javelin in the spine, couldn't walk after that. Used him as a coat rack.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Was you making fun of my Skaarl?
wavs/audio_0108.wav|That it? That was your joke, huh?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|And he ain't even had the indignity to call himself a demon.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Never had much to say, but I'm sure glad we shut him up.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|He died as dumb as he sounded.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I guess it's snake dinner tonight!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I mean, before we killed her. Snake for legs? Crazy!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Girl was all messed up.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Was that lady half-snake, or that snake half-human? She is… confusing. Dead, but confusing.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Hey, lizard food! What exactly was you general of?
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Death bymyhand!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|He wanted to unify Noxus. Guess that makes me a secessionist.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|KLEEEEEED… naw, it's just Kled.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|This is where Kled shines!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Who wants some Kled?
wavs/audio_0122.wav|And you thought I talked crazy!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I gotta stop the mushroom juice… I swear that girl had some tentacles or something!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Skaarl? You eatin' good tonight! That girl's got some meat on her!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Hey, fancy pants! Got your cloak dirty!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I don't know what he was. I just needed him to shut up.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Bye bye, fancy pants!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I can respect crazy, but what kind of fool reloads in the middle of a fight?
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Humans is such easy prey.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|I like a girl with moxie.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|A sinister blade? Heck, girl, Skaarl's got farts more sinister than you was.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|No, obviously she didn't have any! That's the darn point!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Yeah, I'll try it on later.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|She had one crazy getup! Them city-folk clothes is getting ridiculous.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|All your little city-girl dreams just got stomped.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Go back to Noxus Prime!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Queen of what? Darn thing made Skaarl look smart!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|We wrecked that thing!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Damn varmint left holes all over the yard.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Seems to have lost your bounce, girl.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|All that hippy hop! Getting on my nerves!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Pure Noxian girl. Almost liked her. Almost.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I know!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|How many times do I gotta kill him?
wavs/audio_0145.wav|He looks a little overripe.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I don't think you can eat that one.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Huh. I liked him better when he was alive.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Tactician? More like bird brain.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Master Tactician? He can keep that title.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|I figure he gonna taste like chicken.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Sure!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|He gonna taste good deep-fried.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Well, that shut him up!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Finally, some silence.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I knew he was a liar, 'cause he used them big words.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Let that be a lesson for all them sneaky-sneaks!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Another dead city boy, thinking he could sneaky-sneak on my land.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|I've seem some dumb outfits, Skaarl, but a cape made out of knives? Woo, ha! That took the cake!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Hey cous', glad you came to visit!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|A relative's just another unwanted guest.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Just 'cause we was kin don't mean I ain't feeding you to Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|I could feel bad about killing you, or we could stomp on your corpse!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|You ain't cute now!
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Aw, you are so cute… 'fore I ripped your fuzzy head off!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|You was cute—lousy, but cute.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Afraid I had to cut your visit short.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Y'all made a nice stabbing bag.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Next time you visit, bring more stuff I can take!
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Skaarl, that was what we call a predictable scenario.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|They never learn.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I might be a deranged lizard-riding bandito, but I whooped you real good!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|We didn't come here to teach lessons in humanity!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Killing makes me thirsty.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Tried to bushwhack a bushwhacker!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|That'll learn 'em!
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Ahahahaha! I warned him! I did warn him!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|It's funny, 'cause he died right on the border of my land, and more of my land!
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Nothing like a river of blood to send a message.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|This is Noxus, son! Winner takes all!
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Now, I might have overreacted to you unlawfully entering my property—but I don't think so!
wavs/audio_0182.wav|How's that dirt taste?
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Don't let the door hit you on your way to hell!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Don't worry, Skaarl! We'll come back so you can eat 'em later.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|You were a visitor, now you're mulch!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Whoops! Looks like I accidentally stabbed you with my long axe—until you were dead!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|That learned 'em real good.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Thought you could take my land, huh? How'd that work out for you?
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Glad you could visit!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|I told 'em what was gonna happen if they came onto my land!
wavs/audio_0191.wav|You will salute when you address me!
wavs/audio_0192.wav|You get my invitation to visit? No? 'cause there ain't one!
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Let's get 'em, Skaarl!
wavs/audio_0194.wav|You just justified a preemptive retaliatory strike!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|How about a long axe in your guts?
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Look, Skaarl! It's dinner time!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|You see my welcome sign back there? No? It was your friend's skull!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Let's get 'em, 'fore they get us.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Slow down so I can kill something!
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Get off my lawn!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|You mocking me?
wavs/audio_0202.wav|This land is my land!
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Step on my land again, you're done!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|I am justified, and I am armed!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Damn city folk!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|I got your welcoming present right here!
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Oh, it's on!
wavs/audio_0209.wav|You can't bushwhack a bushwhacker!
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Howdy!
wavs/audio_0211.wav|The Princess Bride
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Don't interrupt me! I'm trying to start a fight!
wavs/audio_0213.wav|He looked at me funny! Get him.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Let's get them trespassers!
wavs/audio_0215.wav|This is how it's gonna work: I kill you, then I take your stuff.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|You looking at me? 'cause I'm gonna kill you!
wavs/audio_0217.wav|They came looking for a fight? Let's oblige 'em.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|You can't take what's mine!
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I'm gonna murder you to death!
wavs/audio_0220.wav|My brain is on fire, my soul is strong, and my lizard is hungry!
wavs/audio_0221.wav|You are perturbing my tranquility!
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Let's do it!
wavs/audio_0223.wav|You should run! Skaarl likes his food lively!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|They's about to be dead!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|I will murder your whole family!
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Only coffin's gonna be this lizard's belly!
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Damn trespassers!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Why ain't they saluting me? They should be saluting me! Salute me now!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|The badgers command your death!
wavs/audio_0230.wav|I play with guns. I work with an axe.
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Don't need a plan… long as I got this axe.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|There ain't no land that ain't mine. Just land I ain't got around to claiming.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|They're all trespassers, we're just killing them five first.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Oh, we find 'em, tie 'em up, then they's like a piñata full of meat.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|I am deep-fried courage, and an apple pie of angry!
wavs/audio_0236.wav|I grew up mean and now I'm older than murder.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|No more of that! You're upsetting the invisible badgers!
wavs/audio_0238.wav|Yeah, reminds me of the siege of Ruug. Lot of men died on its high walls. It was fun.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Yeah, they think they so clever! Brains don't win fights, brains is what splatter on you!
wavs/audio_0240.wav|I'm from all over. It's next to nowhere andshut the hell up!
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Fine, you said!
wavs/audio_0242.wav|We was having a nice conversation, then they showed up… uninvited!
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Nah, I'm sure it'll pass.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|I keep hallucinating that you can talk.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Mushrooms are healthy! Once you get used to the madness and paranoia.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Ain't much I love. Only this big sky, and this dumb lizard.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|At the gates of Qualthala, they tried using that boiling oil on us, but you can't deep-fry courage!
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Of course I want to pick a fight with 'em.
wavs/audio_0249.wav|Naw, it's just like the assault on Glorft. You seen one artillery vanguard in a commando fleet action, you seen 'em all.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|No, I'm positive, I ain't delusional! …More than usual…
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Skaarl! This ain't no time for philosophying!
wavs/audio_0252.wav|Shut your hole, you dumb lizard.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Noxus ends where I say it ends.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Are you ready for anything?
wavs/audio_0255.wav|Of course you are!
wavs/audio_0256.wav|No, it's when I don't drink mushroom juice that I have a problem!
wavs/audio_0257.wav|Killing a few things might loosen this up.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|My land begins where I walk. It ends where the sun don't shine!
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Shh! Them brain weasels probably listening for us.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|The sky is my roof, the open plains are my bed, and this lizard is the only company I need.
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Let's get some new property.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|I do prefer to ride into battle.
wavs/audio_0263.wav|Ain't nothing like having the wind on your back and blood on your face.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Don't you bite me again!
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Just 'cause they're our team don't mean we can trust 'em.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|You do come up with the best ideas.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|I don't have trouble communicating. Words is just treacherous bastards.
wavs/audio_0268.wav|Well, you the only thing I trust.
wavs/audio_0269.wav|No! Planning and strategy? That's city-folk stuff!
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Ain't nothing more beautiful than the Noxian plains… excepting a rich corpse.
wavs/audio_0271.wav|It's your birthday, Skaarl! Let's bake a murder cake!
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Let's get to killing them interloping intruders!
wavs/audio_0273.wav|I came to cut off a piece of that Noxian dream… and I ain't sharing my piece!
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Damnit Skaarl, d'you hide my mushroom juice again?
wavs/audio_0275.wav|You ready, Skaarl? This day's gonna require some mindblowing weirdness.
wavs/audio_0276.wav|A man without a weapon ain't worth listening to.
wavs/audio_0277.wav|Hey, it's Forward Admiral Major Kled! I ain't been a Mister since ever!
wavs/audio_0278.wav|What are you whining about? I already fed you half a platoon!
wavs/audio_0279.wav|After we finish murdering these folks, what do you think? Tacos? Yeah, tacos.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|Would you stop bitching for one minute?
wavs/audio_0281.wav|I do not want my lands tamed. I want them unruly and free.
wavs/audio_0282.wav|Of course I'm paranoid! You tried to kill me yesterday!
wavs/audio_0283.wav|They ain't ready for us.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|You can't be lonely when the land is this beautiful.
wavs/audio_0285.wav|Damn cowards, making me ride over to kill 'em.
wavs/audio_0286.wav|Yeah, well, that's what I thought.
wavs/audio_0287.wav|I know, I know.
wavs/audio_0288.wav|The Venture Bros.
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Yeah, I like it out here. Freedom, communing with nature, killing hikers.
wavs/audio_0290.wav|Well, just 'cause you're a hallucination and I don't speak lizard don't mean I can't understand you!
wavs/audio_0291.wav|First, we kill 'em, then we make 'em tell us where they came from.
wavs/audio_0292.wav|Because I know someone is trying to sneak up on us!
wavs/audio_0293.wav|I fight better when I've had my… medicine.
wavs/audio_0294.wav|Nah, them we kill them too! Ain't nobody on my team but you.
wavs/audio_0295.wav|Yeah, but… then how we gonna invade both bases at once?
wavs/audio_0296.wav|This big sky, this green land. Now how could I share this with anyone?
wavs/audio_0297.wav|Shh! It's time to get violent… and weird.
wavs/audio_0298.wav|This land was made for me—and me alone.
wavs/audio_0299.wav|Well, maybe Iamlooking to start a fight!
wavs/audio_0300.wav|Were you just talking, or was it the voices again?
wavs/audio_0301.wav|Woo, it's darn pretty round here. Glad it's mine.
wavs/audio_0302.wav|Was the battle of Fallgren when I first took the rank of Sergeant General Colonel. Least, I think that's what rank they was. Gotta remember to askbeforekilling them.
wavs/audio_0303.wav|Remember when we sacked Trevale, and that general thought we'd be willing to share the spoils? Pheh! Officers die just as easy as anybody.
wavs/audio_0304.wav|I am Kled! High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company! You will respect my authority!
wavs/audio_0305.wav|All we need is open country, but we gonna take everything they got!
wavs/audio_0306.wav|Yeah, they just confirming our suspicions, ain't they?
wavs/audio_0307.wav|Them's humans!
wavs/audio_0308.wav|Naw, they're good eatin'.
wavs/audio_0309.wav|What was that? Oh, I should go for the decakill? Uh, if you say so.
wavs/audio_0310.wav|It's my property! All sixty gazillion acres of it!
wavs/audio_0311.wav|Guess we'll have to kill our way out!
wavs/audio_0312.wav|I'll take 'em alone!
wavs/audio_0313.wav|Not again!
