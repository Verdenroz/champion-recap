Art can shed light on our fears.
Jhin, that was…beautiful.
You shape what I make!
Highlights and shadows!
Steady your hand!
Form the outline!
Be my canvas!
Your true colors!
Give me your full attention!
Watch closely!
Outside the lines!
Part of the whole picture!
Express everything!
Please focus!
No…! Everything's… fading…
Please… I'm still so lost…
Don't… leave me alone… again…
Change your view!
Look to the past!
Face your fears!
Open your eyes.
Keep still.
Stay.
Revealed.
I have you.
Something still grieves in you, Ahri. White, like clouds and ice.
Shrouded in twilight hues. Will you rise again, or set for good, Akali?
Ionians know the contrast between light and dark! Where doyoufall?
We turned art into weapons, Irelia… What would our families think…?
Jhin. You opened my eyes to so much. I won't spare you fromanyof it.
The spirit of Ionia can't guide me, Karma. I need to follow my own light…!
Kayn—blue and red bleed from you!
The eyes do reveal you, Kennen: wild and wise.
Lee Sin, this piece will reach your spirit.
We've seen ashes fill the sky, Yi. I wish we could leave those grey mornings behind.
Let me into your circle, Sett. You have information Ineed.
Shen, you've grown blind to sorrow, to joy… to life.
Sona, your music is your voice. Speak with me!
I know your power, Syndra. The depths of your hurt andrage.
Misery loves company, doesn't it, little one…
Guilt covers us layer by layer, Yasuo.
We carry our burdens with us, Yone: my mind, your mask.
We have a lot in common, Zed. Step out of the shadows and see for yourself.
Let me recreate what you're afraid to confront!
Don't deny what I have to show you!
Keep an open mind, and we'll find meaning together.
Show me who you are, what you're capable of! I'll do the same.
Hmph. That's funny.
You don't need to grieve anymore, Ahri.
From twilight to dusk, Akali.
The first mark sets the tone.
Close your eyes, Jhin. Lie by the fireyoustarted.
Kayn… if you just allowed your selves to blend!
Rest, Yi. You're with your people again.
Art, life, death…!AllI've seen,allmade clear!
We're struck by what finds us alone.
Consumed by the storm, inside and out.
You can't weather the pain on your own.
Live fully in the next life, Shen.
Zed—now we are both alone in our shadows.
Paint fades. Life fades.
I'll create something beautiful in your memory.
I drew the line—you crossed it.
All I imagined… and it still came down to this.
I…
Leave everything to my imagination.
None of us will leave unchanged. I'll make sense of our suffering.
There's no secret to art… just begin and keep going. That's all we can do.
Every question, every burden, every vision: I'll lay them out, here.
Life has to be valued, no seconds wasted… Time is ripped away too quickly.
A single morning changedeverything. So red with blood, flames, and… flowers.
Koyehn is so far from me now. An island of sand, blotted with ash.
Peace of mind is a journey, where you hold every shade of yourself up to the light.
The sky isn't blue and the grass isn't green. Nature stirs in hues I can't name.
It'd be enough for my art to save a single person… Maybe, just myself.
Death is no muse—it bleeds the color from everything it touches.
There's a side of me Ineedto understand. The side left alone; the side in the dark.
What legacy will I leave? What'll survive of me? Even my footsteps, are already gone.
Ioniahas an underworld black as ink. I stare into the well, and it stares back.
At least they'll remember how I make them feel.
Creativity is limitless—for better or worse.
Every mark should have meaning.
Good, evil… the line blurs.
Art is empty without empathy.
People aren't what they say… but what theyshow.
My work seeks answers for the most burning questions.
Why can't I paintexactlywhat I imagine…?
No justice. No revenge. Only clarity.
Life flows in currents. Twisting… Turning.
A heart bared isn't broken… it's freed.
I'll always be a student of the brush, never its master.
One breath and brush at a time.
The surreal makes people admit what's real.
Emotions are most dangerous when silenced.
I'm just a trace of who I was…
Obsession, keeps the mind awake…
Everyone's made of contradictions.
What's heavy in the mind, becomes light on the page.
Act on inspiration when it strikes.
When others fall to pieces, I gather them up.
Nothing's as simple as black and white.
Relive the pain… relieve the pain.
I choose kindness, until I have no choice.
I keep spiraling down paths I never thought I'd walk.
YOUR FINAL SIGHT!
SEE AS I SEE!
FEEL WITH ME!
Moving on means revisiting what was left behind.
A piece is never really finished. Just… abandoned.
No matter where I go… I can't forget where I came from.
I create the quiet that I can't find.
Enough for now. I'll refine the details later.
Loss haunts me like nothing else.
Out of the ashes, into the fire.
No one can take the part of me that just wants to live.
And the colors come flooding back…
Looking
Stop moving, please—you'd make a greatstill-life.
…Sorry? My thoughts were… someplace else.
Quickly now!
Moving waters!
Flow!
Follow the river!
Step by step.
Refuge.
A haven.
Be at ease.
Shelter.
For safety.
A painter meets their subject eye to eye.
