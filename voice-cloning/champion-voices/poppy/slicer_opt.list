Poppy_Original_Attack_0.wav|poppy|en|Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
Poppy_Original_Attack_1.wav|poppy|en|Whoa! You're a big fella!
Poppy_Original_Attack_2.wav|poppy|en|This should really be the hero's job.
Poppy_Original_Attack_3.wav|poppy|en|Wow. That's a lot to hammer.
Poppy_Original_Attack_4.wav|poppy|en|I really don't have anything against dragons.
Poppy_Original_Attack_5.wav|poppy|en|Nothing personal, but... I need to squash you.
Poppy_Original_Attack_6.wav|poppy|en|This guy seems nice. I feel bad about killing him.
Poppy_Original_Attack_7.wav|poppy|en|Sorry, your majesty.
Poppy_Original_Attack_8.wav|poppy|en|You should probably take cover.
Poppy_Original_Attack_9.wav|poppy|en|Swinging from the heels!
Poppy_Original_Attack_10.wav|poppy|en|Here goes everything.
Poppy_Original_Attack_11.wav|poppy|en|You might wanna look out.
Poppy_Original_Attack_12.wav|poppy|en|One whomp at a time.
Poppy_Original_Attack_13.wav|poppy|en|Y-You're in my way!
Poppy_Original_Attack_14.wav|poppy|en|Sorry about this.
Poppy_Original_Attack_15.wav|poppy|en|Better get your guard up.
Poppy_Original_AttackBaron_0.wav|poppy|en|Careful, this packs a wallop.
Poppy_Original_AttackBaron_1.wav|poppy|en|I can do this.
Poppy_Original_AttackBaron_2.wav|poppy|en|No backing down.
Poppy_Original_AttackDragon_0.wav|poppy|en|Guess we're fighting.
Poppy_Original_AttackDragon_1.wav|poppy|en|Ready, hammer?
Poppy_Original_AttackDragon_2.wav|poppy|en|I hope this works.
Poppy_Original_AttackJarvanIV.wav|poppy|en|You are... definitely not the hero.
Poppy_Original_BuyItem_0.wav|poppy|en|Keep swinging till you hit something.
Poppy_Original_BuyItem_1.wav|poppy|en|One shield for throwing, and one for holding.
Poppy_Original_BuyItem_2.wav|poppy|en|A hammer for my hammer.
Poppy_Original_BuyItem_3.wav|poppy|en|I'll just add it to my other hammer.
Poppy_Original_BuyItemAegisOfTheLegion.wav|poppy|en|Well, two hammers are better than one.
Poppy_Original_BuyItemCaulfieldsWarhammer_0.wav|poppy|en|Hmm... nice weapon. Does it come in hammer?
Poppy_Original_BuyItemCaulfieldsWarhammer_1.wav|poppy|en|You smash people with it, right?
Poppy_Original_BuyItemCaulfieldsWarhammer_2.wav|poppy|en|It's a little big, but I'll grow into it.
Poppy_Original_BuyItemNeedlesslyLargeRod_0.wav|poppy|en|Yeah. Just like the hero would buy.
Poppy_Original_BuyItemNeedlesslyLargeRod_1.wav|poppy|en|Got me some hammer accessories.
Poppy_Original_BuyItemWarmogsArmor.wav|poppy|en|Goes great with a hammer.
Poppy_Original_Death_0.wav|poppy|en|Yay, more stuff!
Poppy_Original_E_0.wav|poppy|en|Right in my hammer...
Poppy_Original_E_1.wav|poppy|en|Don't move!
Poppy_Original_E_2.wav|poppy|en|Freeze!
Poppy_Original_E_3.wav|poppy|en|You. Sit!
Poppy_Original_EStun_0.wav|poppy|en|Hold it right there!
Poppy_Original_EStun_1.wav|poppy|en|Look out!
Poppy_Original_EStun_2.wav|poppy|en|Move it!
Poppy_Original_EStun_3.wav|poppy|en|Back off!
Poppy_Original_FirstEncounterChogath.wav|poppy|en|Outta' my way!
Poppy_Original_FirstEncounterJayce.wav|poppy|en|You sure you wanna do this? You don't even have a weapon.
Poppy_Original_FirstEncounterLeona.wav|poppy|en|Look at all that shiny armor. Sorry I gotta mess it up.
Poppy_Original_FirstEncounterTaric.wav|poppy|en|I'm about to hammer you in the jewels.
Poppy_Original_FirstEncounterYordle.wav|poppy|en|I don't get Yordles. Too fluffy.
Poppy_Original_Joke_0.wav|poppy|en|A Demacian, a Noxian and a Freljordian walk into a tavern.
Poppy_Original_Joke_1.wav|poppy|en|And the Piltie says, 'Can I own this ba--- uh, I own this bank, so...' He doesn't want anything because heownsthe bank...
Poppy_Original_Joke_2.wav|poppy|en|The barkeep asks, 'What'll it be?'
Poppy_Original_Joke_3.wav|poppy|en|The Demacian says, 'Uh, I'll have a wine.' No, wait, an ale! Yeah...
Poppy_Original_Joke_4.wav|poppy|en|Then the Noxian says, 'I'll have a... a wine.' Yeah, he wants a wine.
Poppy_Original_Joke_5.wav|poppy|en|And the Freljordian says, 'I'll drink anything, so long as--- ' Wait, hold on, let me start over.
Poppy_Original_Joke_6.wav|poppy|en|A Noxian, a Targonian and a Piltie are robbing a bank.
Poppy_Original_Joke_7.wav|poppy|en|The bank guy says, 'I'll give you whatever you want.'
Poppy_Original_Joke_8.wav|poppy|en|The Noxian says, 'I'll take whatever gold you got back there.'
Poppy_Original_Joke_9.wav|poppy|en|The Targonian says, 'Gimme' all your gemstones!'
Poppy_Original_Joke_10.wav|poppy|en|I got lucky—you'll get me next time.
Poppy_Original_Kill_0.wav|poppy|en|I'm running out of heroes.
Poppy_Original_Kill_1.wav|poppy|en|I wish they'd give up trying to stop me, but I can understand their position.
Poppy_Original_Kill_2.wav|poppy|en|They try to knock me down, but I have a low center of gravity.
Poppy_Original_Kill_3.wav|poppy|en|Aaannd, my search continues.
Poppy_Original_Kill_4.wav|poppy|en|Well, that wasn't the hero.
Poppy_Original_Kill_5.wav|poppy|en|You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common.
Poppy_Original_Move_0.wav|poppy|en|Oh, wow, Garen, do you think you could sign my shield?
Poppy_Original_Move_1.wav|poppy|en|Garen, I think you might be the one!
Poppy_Original_Move_2.wav|poppy|en|A pleasure to fight for you, your majesty.
Poppy_Original_Move_3.wav|poppy|en|The hammer isn't mine, just keeping it until the real guy shows up.
Poppy_Original_Move_4.wav|poppy|en|I've heard a lot about this hero with a hammer, can't wait to meet him.
Poppy_Original_Move_5.wav|poppy|en|Not coming back 'til I find that hero.
Poppy_Original_Move_6.wav|poppy|en|One time I thought I found the hero... but he died.
Poppy_Original_Move_7.wav|poppy|en|Today's the day I find that hero.
Poppy_Original_Move_8.wav|poppy|en|Hmm... if I were a hero, where would I hide...?
Poppy_Original_Move_9.wav|poppy|en|Who knew there were so many heroes?
Poppy_Original_Move_10.wav|poppy|en|Sometimes you just gotta do it yourself.
Poppy_Original_Move_11.wav|poppy|en|Me? The hero? Nah, that's ridiculous.
Poppy_Original_Move_12.wav|poppy|en|Yep, it's even heavier than it looks.
Poppy_Original_Move_13.wav|poppy|en|If you're waiting for me to give up, you might be here a while.
Poppy_Original_Move_14.wav|poppy|en|Okay, I admit it. I'm lost.
Poppy_Original_Move_15.wav|poppy|en|Know what I could use? A cart.
Poppy_Original_Move_16.wav|poppy|en|The hammer does most of the work, I just swing it.
Poppy_Original_Move_17.wav|poppy|en|Every step is one step closer.
Poppy_Original_Move_18.wav|poppy|en|I sure do a lot of walking.
Poppy_Original_Move_19.wav|poppy|en|I hope the hero likes me.
Poppy_Original_Move_20.wav|poppy|en|I'm in, one-hundred-percent! That's everything, right?
Poppy_Original_Move_21.wav|poppy|en|Some things are too important to give up on.
Poppy_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|poppy|en|Just had a thought—three pigtails!
Poppy_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|poppy|en|Man, quests are hard.
Poppy_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|poppy|en|I could really go for a nap.
Poppy_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|poppy|en|Guess I'm going this way now.
Poppy_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|poppy|en|Oh, you like to fight? So does my hammer!
Poppy_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|poppy|en|What do you mean my hammer's too big?
Poppy_Original_MoveFirstAllyGalio.wav|poppy|en|How Demacian of you!
Poppy_Original_MoveFirstAllyGaren_0.wav|poppy|en|Donotmake my hammer mad.
Poppy_Original_MoveFirstAllyGaren_1.wav|poppy|en|I gotta see this through.
Poppy_Original_MoveFirstAllyJarvan.wav|poppy|en|Got it.
Poppy_Original_P2_0.wav|poppy|en|Shieldy...
Poppy_Original_P2_1.wav|poppy|en|Hope it's not dented.
Poppy_Original_P2_2.wav|poppy|en|Left hand!
Poppy_Original_PAttack_0.wav|poppy|en|Shield to the face!
Poppy_Original_PAttack_hit_0.wav|poppy|en|Clang!
Poppy_Original_PAttack_hit_1.wav|poppy|en|Comin' down!
Poppy_Original_Q_0.wav|poppy|en|Hammer!
Poppy_Original_Q_1.wav|poppy|en|And stay there!
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_0.wav|poppy|en|And don't come back!
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_1.wav|poppy|en|Remember to roll!
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_2.wav|poppy|en|Look at him go!
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_3.wav|poppy|en|Huh. Didn't know I could do that.
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_4.wav|poppy|en|Whoa. You went far.
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_5.wav|poppy|en|Up goes the guy!
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_6.wav|poppy|en|Whomp!
Poppy_Original_RMissile_hit_7.wav|poppy|en|Wait, what did I come back for?
Poppy_Original_RecallEnd_0.wav|poppy|en|Anyone seen a hero around here?
Poppy_Original_RecallEnd_1.wav|poppy|en|Now, back to finding that hero.
Poppy_Original_RecallEnd_2.wav|poppy|en|That's okay. I'm playing the long game.
Poppy_Original_Respawn_0.wav|poppy|en|One thing about me: I'm not good at staying down.
Poppy_Original_Respawn_1.wav|poppy|en|Let's try that again.
Poppy_Original_Respawn_2.wav|poppy|en|This hammer has two sides. Did you want to feel the other one too?
Poppy_Original_Taunt_0.wav|poppy|en|Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
Poppy_Original_Taunt_1.wav|poppy|en|Could you maybe get out of the way? Y'know, so I don't have to flatten you.
Poppy_Original_Taunt_2.wav|poppy|en|Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, uh... hammer!
Poppy_Original_Taunt_3.wav|poppy|en|To the hero!
Poppy_Original_UseItemHealthPotion_0.wav|poppy|en|Fuel for the quest.
Poppy_Original_UseItemHealthPotion_1.wav|poppy|en|Alright, sneakies... I know you're out there.
Poppy_Original_UseItemWard_0.wav|poppy|en|...Just in case they come creeping.
Poppy_Original_UseItemWard_1.wav|poppy|en|Hold on...
Poppy_Original_WBuffSuper_0.wav|poppy|en|Not like this!
Poppy_Original_WBuffSuper_1.wav|poppy|en|Keep fighting...
Poppy_Original_WBuffSuper_2.wav|poppy|en|Not today!
Poppy_Original_WBuffSuper_3.wav|poppy|en|No getting through me.
Poppy_Original_WKnockUp_0.wav|poppy|en|Hold up!
Poppy_Original_WKnockUp_1.wav|poppy|en|Nope.
Poppy_Original_WKnockUp_2.wav|poppy|en|Uh uh.
Poppy_Original_WKnockUp_3.wav|poppy|en|What's the hurry?
Poppy_Original_WKnockUp_4.wav|poppy|en|I'm no hero—just a Yordle with a hammer.
