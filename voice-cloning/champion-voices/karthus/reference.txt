Ah, the kiss of death.
It is written.
Ah, the kiss of death.
Sleep without dreams.
I crave the parting.
Revel in the undoing.
Release your mortal coil.
Sleep now, child.
Darkness envelops you.
Hear my song.
The rhythm of your life slows.
Join the chorus of death.
Your time has come.
I sing the word of death.
Die by my hand, and rise anew.
Rest in peace.
Expire.
Angels too, are the messengers of death.
Host of angels, or murder of crows?
A companion for all time.
Its power grows with time... as does mine.
Ah, the song grows.
I hear the echo of Rabadon; it is exquisite.
A crown for the king of death.
Its old master served my patron well.
None can outrun death.
This crystal will sing with me.
When death's grip finds you, it clings tightly.
A tear of loss, a tear of joy.
What can protect you from the inevitable?
No one can hide from the end.
The grave has all the time in the world.
Freeze that moment, on the threshold of oblivion.
The sands slip away like lives.
Waaao!
Behold your undoing!
The shell means nothing!
Sing, my children.
Behold my chorus.
Countless voices in unison!
Rise and sing!
Feel the spirits.
You will not die alone.
You deceive your followers. I will enlighten them.
Death's horse needs no bridle.
You are but the herald, Hecarim. Remember who you truly serve.
Your light is but a candle in the infinite dark.
Abandon your mortality, and find your precious Senna.
You can always join her, Lucian. It will be bliss!
Lucian! Join her!
A shell of flesh or a shell of metal? Both ring hollow.
You give the dead purpose, Mordekaiser. I give them meaning.
Sion, we must free your soul from the prison of flesh.
You are only the echo of greatness, but I can give you a voice again!
You may shackle the living, but the dead must walk free.
Death has more meaning than torment alone, warden.
You are on the eve of liberation, Varus.
Sorry, I'm booked through... er, brrrr... forever.
Listen, mortals, as I speak the word of... my cookbook.
Dear diary, met a wonderful ghoul today...
So many souls await.
We all have a place among the divine. We have only to accept it.
My pilgrimage begins.
Solace comes with a still heart.
Shed no tears for the dead.
Soon, all will wane.
You have been dying from your first breath.
We are forever.
You all die, why not choose how?
The Shadow Isles sing louder than any siren.
You are a doomed vessel.
The faithful never fear the grave.
Truth is what I offer.
In the end, only the dead shall remain.
Pain is the herald of your salvation.
May death free us all.
Hear the elegy of the lost.
You will forget breath, you will forget love.
Death is a song all will hear.
Never hunger, never tire, never fear.
Follow my voice, and slip away.
You are only the cocoon.
Have you ever felt a calling?
I can give you certainty.
What trickery is life?
You are the candle burning unto nothing.
Death is but a horizon.
A dirge, for those who remain!
Surrender!
Listen and rejoicein death!
Die!
Cease to be!
Sing with your final breath!
Hear me,mortals!
Perish!
When I return, more shall join my choir.
I go where death bids me.
Death prevails.
I will shred your body, and burn your soul!
To feel the caress of death for the first time... I envy you!
The song of your life will be brief.
Your death will be excruciating!
Life clings like a parasite to a soul!
Dead eyes never blink.
I watch.
Death sees all.
Feel the frailty of life!
You cannot escape.
Your bodies betray you!
Cross over.
To flee is to suffer.
Agony, ecstasy, peace. Every passing has a beauty all its own.
