wavs/audio_0001.wav|You're duller than a broken sandwich.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Beast, you are a rank dish! Ill served!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|This is my river, you scoundrel!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|You dare invade my table?
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I must sample this buffet.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|New tastes.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|I will consume all.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Yummy.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|A feast awaits.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|How delectable.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Meat!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Mine!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Feed!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|More!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Dinner!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Hunger!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Something to nibble on.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Fresh souls!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Another meal.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|An enticing culinary prospect.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Another snack.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Delicious.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Savor the misery.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Might be savory.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Their despair... is the seasoning.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|A heart is so easily... eaten.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|There is something sublime about holding a heart in your hand.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|How did I leave my jacket pocket unadorned for so long?
wavs/audio_0029.wav|I am sanctuary for those in my favour.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I can provide all manner of refuge.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I have a hunger for... fine shoes.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I wonder who might like to bargain for a little freedom.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I am an omen of voracity.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|A little sedation for my more noisesome neighbours.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|A handy tool for the next time I'm... in between meals.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Truly this is the best way to enjoy a buffet.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I pity the hydra. So many heads intent on sharing the meal.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Something about this blade feels... redundant.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Sorcery is a distasteful habit.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I refuse to trouble myself with charlatans.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|My visage was already flawless, now it just has more vigor.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|A gentleman without a cape is only half-dressed.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Fire warms the spirit, and charges the appetite.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|War is an appetite like any other.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Say what you will, a large man cannotbe ignored.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|A hearty appetite pairs best with a robust constitution.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Was that an attack, or an hors d'oeuvre?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|My constitution is unflappable!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You have succeeded only in ruffling my attire!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|How droll your attacks are!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Brother, you're as cultured as a crematorium selling barbecue.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|War is a manly appetite, and your directness has my admiration.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I am enthralled by your class and refinement. I must offer you a token of my admirations.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|You're as modest as a freshly-paid courtesan.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Hiding in smoke? Young lady, you're as sharp as a bag of slugs.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I believe 'decorum' is the china shop.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Any pejorative of bullheadedness is pulverized by your magnificence.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I say, you're as 'fun' as a leaky roof.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Coveting friendship is barely an appetite, but one I do so sympathize with.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I suppose I must defrost you first.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Idiocy is often mistaken for innocence.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Girl, you got as much 'foresight' as a blindfolded mole.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|If you wanna build an empire of peace, then your mortar will be blood.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Son, your empire was built on sand.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You're the emperor... of mashed potatoes and gravy.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|An emperor as humble as he is beloved.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|If your heart is gold and your body is steel, why's tin between your ears?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|My mustache will eat yours.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The heart of the Freljord must long for something.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|You're strong like bull, and smart like cow.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|You're as elegant as an outhouse in a leper colony!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|If you want to clean up the city, don't you need to understand where that dirt comes from?
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Your hunger deserves to be satisfied.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Personally I hunger for things less literal.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Your strength is waning, General. 'Course, I can help you slow time's regress.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|You're as subtle as a gold codpiece.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I presume you are the waiter at this establishment.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Vengeance is a thirst I could help you quench.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Girl, you're crazier than a mouse in moonshine.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Your diction is as exemplary as your intellect.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I can show Mundo new places to go, if he pleases.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I wonder, how can you receive the attention you deserve... while your brother is in the way?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Your hunger for attention deserves to be sated.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|At least the rumor of your vanity isn't overrated.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Time is but another river, and I care not what water I swim in.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Your youthful rebellion is as tedious as your hairstyle.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Youthful ignorance is unfortunately your best quality.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Why should a hunger for adventure ever be sated?
wavs/audio_0090.wav|A duel is a fight between two imbeciles... and you are the greatest.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|An appetite for a challenge is a craving without liability.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Wouldn't you care to travel to your people's destination?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Your attempt to be monstrous is as successful as your dictatorship.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|You're a man with troubles. I have solutions.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|You live by a code that'll never let you get what you want. Let me take you to her.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Are you the waiter of this establishment?
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Your conversation makes as much sense as a fish in lingerie!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Time is just a river, boy. Let me take you back where you belong.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Your tastes are as elegant as a broken latrine.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I admire a man of appetites. Let me help you find refreshment.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Girl, you're as appealing as a cake in the rain.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|There's a storm in your heart, girl. Tell me what you hunger for.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Anything getting through that gold helmet of yours?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Only a fool wouldn't hunger for the throne. Let me help you find that seat.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|It is wonderful to be hungry for a challenge.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Boy, you are a few candles short of a lantern.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|A drive for innovation? It's just a hunger for something new.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Dumber than a box of hammers.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|An appetite for chaos? Let me feed that mayhem.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Girl, if brains were dynamite, you'd be a dud.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Don't starve your heart, child! Let me deliver you to him.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Truth requires a journey on blind faith.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Good ideas fall from you like pudding from a harpy.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Could I offer you a bargain to replace your previous engagement?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Step closer, and I'll carry you to your prize.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|A fool and his love are easily parted.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|The enormity of the hat doesn't hide the vacancy beneath it!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The road to vengeance requires a journey I would happily provide.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|A journey to a moonstone is one I could provide.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|The tides call you sashimi.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Forgiveness is a shore like any other.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|You're like a roofless mansion â€“ impressively useless.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I appreciate your mind is unsullied by the complications of reason.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Allow me to facilitate your rapaciousness.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|You are a traveler... and I provide transport.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|You read words and mistake that for understanding
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Let me make a meal with your ambition.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|You're as witty as you are subtle.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Why not travel to when you were free from these doubts?
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Your tastes are about as sophisticated as your wardrobe.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Every heart has its own hunger. Tell me yours.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|You're as likable as a rat in a bridle shop.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Bilgewater is a rough town to leave. I could make it easier for you.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|A gambler's luck is only predictable... when he's a cheat.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|A boxer who thinks with her fists must inevitably punch with her face.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Child, why would you sublimate a hunger? Have you forgotten who you are?
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Do you want to reach your potential? It's a journey I could provide.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|A slave's mind is never free, but I suspect you got yours on discount.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Ah, nothing whets my appetite like the flames of ambition gone awry.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Your destiny isn't in the wind. It's on the river.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|You're as quick as a turtle on molasses.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|So, shiny attire seem like the thing to wear? You are the most intelligent ninja in the world.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Child, a shadow must run from the light eventually.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Let us peruse this establishment's fare.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|It is the heart from which the darkest water flows.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|This buffet exceeds repugnance!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|It is my mouth into which all travels end.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|I see nothing splendiferous in this table's offerings!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Does your establishmenthaveany tables?
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I refuse to succumb to culinary degradation!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|The only real sin is to deny a craving.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|To covet is to starve.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|True appetite never wanes.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Let us eat voraciously and overindulge.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|I have tastes that aren't easily... pacified.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I am appetite focused.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Misery has a delectable taste.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Gluttony is impossible.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Now we shall gluttonize.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Every heart has its own hunger.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|We all gourmandize from time to time.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|My diet is expensively unique.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|No true hunger can be abated.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|From suffering, my banquet is born.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|That aroma seduces...
wavs/audio_0166.wav|A bargain is due!
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Give it to me!
wavs/audio_0168.wav|The river never stops!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Where is it!?
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Where is that taste?
wavs/audio_0171.wav|The world is my feast!
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Every river ends in me!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|All shall drown in my magnificence.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|I demand an entrÃ©e!
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Hunger!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|I am the River King!
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Mercy has no flavor!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|A depth of flavor is what I covet.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Anything of depth is deceitful.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|All creation is born famished and starving.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Everyone ends downriver... eventually.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Nothing escapes hunger.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Disgusting!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Repugnant!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Unacceptable!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Needs salt!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Nauseating!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Revolting!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Vile!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Travel awaits.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Take the bargain.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Over here!
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Come closer, child.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Closer.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Step inside.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Get inside!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|This way!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|I shall return to this establishment shortly.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Regrettably, I must retire in order to find a digestive.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Your mind is as clear as mud.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|You are a malodorous offense to my palate!
wavs/audio_0202.wav|The baseness of your appetite repulses me!
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Child, you're a couple cows short of a steak!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|You're duller than a broken sandwich.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Finally, my enormity matches my appetite.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Even when you have no bait, you can still cast a line and hope.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|A true meal requires foresight to manifest.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|I prefer to know when my next meal approaches.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|I search for bargains wherever fools cross my domain.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Call me king, call me demon. Water forgets the names of the drowned.
