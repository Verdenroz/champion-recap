wavs/audio_0001.wav|No cure for fools.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I'll give you the easy way out.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Kill me? You can try.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|People keep running into my blade.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I alone decide my fate.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|One blade, one purpose.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Some things never dull.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|It's just death. Nothing serious.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Make it quick.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Yojimbo
wavs/audio_0011.wav|No more running.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Some mistakes you can't make twice.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I will not die dishonored.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Don't start what I'll finish.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|At peace with yourself? You will be.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|It is not yet time to die.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Wuju? Hmph. Never heard of it.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Nice... sword... boots?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|You can't run from yourself, Riven... I've tried.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Broken sword. Broken spirit.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Everyone faces a reckoning, Riven.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Which weighs more, Riven? Your blade, or your past?
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Huh, three swift strikes...
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Wait, that technique... huh.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Another wind blade?
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Who taught you that?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Scurry back to your shadows, ninja.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Indiana Jones
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Cute mask. Your, uh, mom sew that?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|An unworthy blade meets a cursed mask.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Brother, what have you become?
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Yone, I learned your lessons too late.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|The blade above all things... except a good drink.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Who says I can't handle my drink?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|There are three certainties in life: honor, death, and hangovers.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|It always ends in blood, brother.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Whispers on the wind speak of a masked swordsman with two blades.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|My brother returned. Seems dyingwasthe easy part.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|This story is not yet finished.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Justice. That's a pretty word.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Never could stay in one place.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Honor is in the heart, not the name.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Sleep is for the guiltless.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|My honor left a long time ago.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I will not forget who I am.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|A sword's poor company for a long road.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Hmph... dying's the easy part.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|The road to ruin is shorter than you think.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I thoughtAzakanawere nothing but children's tales. How wrong I was.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|This blade never gets any lighter.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Is a leaf's only purpose to fall?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Just looking for a road home.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Follow the wind, but watch your back.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I will follow this path until the end.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Virtue is no more than a luxury.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Hmph. One step ahead of the past.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|No one is promised tomorrow.

wavs/audio_0066.wav|There is only death... mine, or yours!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Killing people is a bad habit... but I can't seem to quit.
