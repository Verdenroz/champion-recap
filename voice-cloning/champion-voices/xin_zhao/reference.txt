Your hunger dies here, foul thing!
I have silenced louder creatures in darker pits.
Demacia always stood against flame and scale.
Fate made you;Iwill unmake you.
Do not hesitate.
This ends in silence.
You call that a stance?
Less flourish, more fighting.
Tighten your guard.
Your life is forfeit!
You flinched!
Not while I stand.
For the crown!
No cheers for you.
Hardly a threat.
Here is a tip—and a spear behind it.
Your form is loud.
Come now, do better.
Demacia… must endure…
My king… forgive this failure…
Jarvan… lead them…
Reckoner to reckoner: you know what comes next.
Another beast that thinks itself immortal.
It is true then… The boy I knew is dead.
You have strayed from the righteous path!
Brash. Vain. Unwashed. You must be Draven.
Your name is your oath, Crownguard, andbothare in question.
My spirit may be rooted in Ionia, but my duty is to Demacia.
You shame your father's crown!
The storm within you clouds your judgment, Master Kennen.
Your mask becomes you, deceiver.
I once bled for Noxus—today, you will bleed for me.
You remind me of all those reckoners no one remembers.
Return the crown, butcher, or I will carve it from your face!
It saddens me to see you so far from home, with discord in your heart.
Your temple lies in ruins, Yunara. Do not follow its fate.
I trained a prince. You fight like a squire!
The crown's justice has found you!
Your footwork says much—none of it good.
Fate rarely gives warnings;thisis yours.
Hup! Hyah! Please inform the king I landed safely.
We could have stood together. Instead, you fall alone.
Fate brought us here, demon. The spear did the rest.
Scorched, and still I stand.
Nothing left standing.
Cleared in the crown's name.
Your age has passed, darkin. Stay buried.
You are no god, only a disappointment.
I had hoped never to spill Demacian blood again.
Whatever this was, demon, it is done.
Reckoner down. Send up the next.
Hear that? Noxus cheers your fall.
First to fall!
Demacia did not merely lose a sword. It lost its heart.
May your spirit choose a more enlightened path.
One of us lost our way. I hope… it was not me.
What am I to tell your father, lad? Or our people?
I was sure you would outlive us all, Master Kennen.
Your schemes die with you, deceiver.
Another death Noxus will not mourn.
I AM BUT ONE DEMACIAN! IMAGINE AN ARMY!
You are no colossus.
The insult to the throne has been answered… in kind.
Not in my master's kingdom.
Bloodshed averted.
You call that subtle?
Demacia clears the path.
Better the myth than what you became.
Hesitation… that is all it took.
Another falls, the crowd cheers.
Lesson learned… the hard way.
Perhaps you will find strength in the next life.
Stand tall, Demacian, we must defend the shieldless!
My prince, heed your training. The lance may falter, but you must not.
Your lessons keep me grounded, Master Kennen.
Lady Sona, if I fall today, let your song carry me home.
I stand at your side once more, Yunara.
'Seneschal' is a title. A duty. The king's sworn protector and most trusted advisor.
If the people of this world forget what truly matters, I will remind them.
I am the king's spear, driven into the heart of the unjust.
To protect something greater than yourself—that is why I serveDemacia.
Demacia is a fighter full of promise: gifted and disciplined, but still untested.
I fought in the arenas of Noxus. First to avoid punishment, then because I was good at it.
Why would fate choose a boy from a fishing boat to serve a king? We may never know.
Of the many masters I have served, there is only one I would call friend.
May I serve as the seneschal of Demacia until my final breath.
Every step carries the weight of two lives: the one I lost and the one I chose.
Demacia's walls are strongest when our gates remain open.
I once thrilled the crowds. Now I serve the king of Demacia.
A king's gift is never free; this spear came with purpose and cause.
There is no peace for me… but duty offers a measure of stillness to my spirit.
I would rather die fighting for the shieldless, than live out my days in regret.
Fate offered me a second chance, and I took it.
I carry the weight of the king's trust with each step.
I go where the king commands.
I would pay a king's ransom for a cup ofIoniantea.
Follow the just path, no matter how narrow.
My eyes are sharp. Thesilverwingswould agree.
Finally, freedom from all that courtly gossip…!
Nothing soothes old wounds like an Ionian healer.
I am bound by oath, not birth.
Better to move forward than dwell on the past.
A warrior learns to read the sound of footsteps.
The royal accounts can wait.
One sweep of the palace, five new problems.
Demacia is not perfect, but it tries.
Noxustaught me survival—nothing else.
A warrior moves with purpose.
I fight for the dream of Demacia.
The pits broke everything but my spirit.
The king's spear obeys.
Flinch and fall!
Strike true!
Staggered!
FACE THE KING'S SPEAR!
A thousand battles mean nothing—only the last one matters.
It is better to walk away upright than crawl back humbled.
A reckoner rests between bouts. A seneschal returns to serve.
I must confer with the king.
A brutal reminder that fate has no favorites.
A lesson to be learned for certain.
A warrior may fall, but duty persists.
The 'great Viscero', hmph… Get back out there.
Neither my spear nor my spirit falters.
You are very confident for someone so unproven.
Make way!
Brace for the lesson!
Right through you!
Clear a path!
One spear, one thousand battles.
