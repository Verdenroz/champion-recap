Did daddy buy you that gun?
Less hat, more pants.
Belts? Is dressing like a commoner fashionable now?
The law protects when it is protected.
How very... Noxian of you.
You are behaving like an imbecile.
You are not thinking far enough ahead.
'Hourglass kid'? Was 'sundial brat' already taken?
Child. I've considered every outcome, plan accordingly.
That little toy of yours won't help you when you're dead.
Shush now! Leave the talking to the adults.
You might be decent practice.
It would have been better for you to stay dead.
Do you have a formula for being better?
I suppose I must teachyoua lesson.

Mmmh... it's like looking into a crude, boorish mirror.
So direct; like most fools.
Watch it, girl. I am your future.
Ever wonder how you became an orphan?
Tell me. Is it the third arm that makes you extra-glorious?
Oh, your revolution is so... quaint.
Your revolution has ceased to be useful.
You have become an obstacle to progress. Time to remove you.
You would look better as a rug in my foyer.
Shouldn't you be on a leash?
Didn't your master teach you to heel?
We are all monsters. Now, you are just one on the outside.
Here, doggy.
I'm the one who keeps the wolves at bay.
You are quick, but I am quicker.
Think ahead, or start digging your grave.
I am a weapon. You're some sort of... pudding.
All flash and no substance.
Oh look, it's the worst of times.
Don't beg for attention—it's unbecoming.

All bluster, no execution.
My boy, no one cares about your silly little country.
Is that the result you were looking for?
I suppose dying is the ultimate lesson.
You should have relied on your weapons more.
Today's forecast? Your death.
Funny thing about heroes; they all end up dead.
