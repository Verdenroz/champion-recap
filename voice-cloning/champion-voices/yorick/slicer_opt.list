Yorick_Original_BuyItemIcebornGauntlet_1.wav|yorick|en|Cold, even to my touch.
Yorick_Original_BuyItemIcebornGauntlet_2.wav|yorick|en|As cold as the hand of death.
Yorick_Original_BuyItemRubyCrystal_0.wav|yorick|en|Red is the heart that barely beats in me.
Yorick_Original_BuyItemRubyCrystal_1.wav|yorick|en|A vital ornament.
Yorick_Original_BuyItemRubyCrystal_2.wav|yorick|en|It pulses with life, as theIslesonce did.
Yorick_Original_BuyItemSpiritVisage_0.wav|yorick|en|Sometimes the dead can give life.

Yorick_Original_EHit_4.wav|yorick|en|A curse upon the ground.
Yorick_Original_EHit_5.wav|yorick|en|It claims you.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterAnnie.wav|yorick|en|They say I was once your age, though I can't quite recall.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterAzir.wav|yorick|en|Your corpses against mine. May the best win.

Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterLucian.wav|yorick|en|No, Lucian, I haven't seen your wife.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterLux.wav|yorick|en|You remind me that the world is sometimes good... and very naive.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterMaokai.wav|yorick|en|I fight to free you as well, though a hatchet would suffice.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterMordekaiser.wav|yorick|en|My army will soon storm your gates, revenant.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterRyze.wav|yorick|en|Yours is a fool's errand. The world must be allowed to die.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterSinged.wav|yorick|en|You think you want immortality. I'll gladly give you mine.
Yorick_Original_FirstEncounterThresh.wav|yorick|en|Those souls are not yours to keep.

Yorick_Original_Joke.wav|yorick|en|Ah, missed it. There it goes! Where is it at— Ah! Yes!
Yorick_Original_JokeAmumu.wav|yorick|en|Ah, would you like some friends? Nope, can't have 'em.
Yorick_Original_JokeResponse.wav|yorick|en|I suppose I have eternity to think about that one.
Yorick_Original_KillShadowIsles.wav|yorick|en|One more nail in the coffin of theIsles.

Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|yorick|en|Join us in eternity, Yorick.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|yorick|en|This land will never heal. But I will lay it to rest.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|yorick|en|Tired, ancient, and half-dead. Still, I come for you.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|yorick|en|Let us in, remove your chains.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|yorick|en|Yorick, look what you've become.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|yorick|en|I am the rift between life and death. The thin divide between breath and grave.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|yorick|en|Your human form is so confining. You could be infinite.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_7.wav|yorick|en|We see you, Yorick. We know your weakness.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_8.wav|yorick|en|I once had honor... before theRuination.
Yorick_Original_MoveFirst_9.wav|yorick|en|There is no hope.
Yorick_Original_Move_0.wav|yorick|en|I carry these souls to their end... wherever it may be.
Yorick_Original_Move_1.wav|yorick|en|Tears of life preserve me.
Yorick_Original_Move_10.wav|yorick|en|TheRuined King'sallies shall fall with him.
Yorick_Original_Move_11.wav|yorick|en|My curse is our only hope.
Yorick_Original_Move_12.wav|yorick|en|What hell is worse than this limbo?
Yorick_Original_Move_13.wav|yorick|en|I do not live in hope. I work to return it.
Yorick_Original_Move_14.wav|yorick|en|The dead don't hear you, no matter how you cry.
Yorick_Original_Move_15.wav|yorick|en|One can stare into the grave too long.
Yorick_Original_Move_16.wav|yorick|en|Soon, this depravity will end.
Yorick_Original_Move_18.wav|yorick|en|This journey is long, but I will complete it.
Yorick_Original_Move_19.wav|yorick|en|These isles... how they scream.
Yorick_Original_Move_2.wav|yorick|en|We shall prevail. We have eternity.
Yorick_Original_Move_20.wav|yorick|en|Tell me of the beyond... in case I never make it.
Yorick_Original_Move_21.wav|yorick|en|Death is not to be feared.
Yorick_Original_Move_22.wav|yorick|en|The dead have not forgotten.
Yorick_Original_Move_23.wav|yorick|en|They once called these isles undying. Yet die, they will.
Yorick_Original_Move_24.wav|yorick|en|From the ground they come, and to it, they return.
Yorick_Original_Move_25.wav|yorick|en|All things fade... but me.
Yorick_Original_Move_26.wav|yorick|en|The beyond is waiting. Strive to meet it.
Yorick_Original_Move_27.wav|yorick|en|Everyone I knew is dead. How are things with you?
Yorick_Original_Move_28.wav|yorick|en|How quick the turn from blessed to cursed.
Yorick_Original_Move_29.wav|yorick|en|Death used to mean something.
Yorick_Original_Move_3.wav|yorick|en|Our souls are a small price to pay to cleanse this land.
Yorick_Original_Move_30.wav|yorick|en|Ours is a fate worse than death.
Yorick_Original_Move_31.wav|yorick|en|I am no tyrant. These souls act on their own.
Yorick_Original_Move_32.wav|yorick|en|Hallowed or profane... I no longer know.
Yorick_Original_Move_33.wav|yorick|en|We're dead much longer than we are alive.
Yorick_Original_Move_34.wav|yorick|en|I go wherever souls are adrift.
Yorick_Original_Move_35.wav|yorick|en|The constant wailing of souls in torment.
Yorick_Original_Move_36.wav|yorick|en|So many souls, so few bodies.
Yorick_Original_Move_37.wav|yorick|en|It hurts to remember.
Yorick_Original_Move_38.wav|yorick|en|What I do is just. Every horrid piece of it.
Yorick_Original_Move_39.wav|yorick|en|What a beautiful dream is life.
Yorick_Original_Move_4.wav|yorick|en|I remember when I put theminthe ground.
Yorick_Original_Move_40.wav|yorick|en|I do not know what lies beyond. But it is better than this.
Yorick_Original_Move_41.wav|yorick|en|Water for the living, shovel for the dead.
Yorick_Original_Move_42.wav|yorick|en|If they could see what I see, they'd long for death.
Yorick_Original_Move_43.wav|yorick|en|To most, life is fleeting; to me, it is quagmire.
Yorick_Original_Move_44.wav|yorick|en|Death is not always a release.
Yorick_Original_Move_45.wav|yorick|en|TheRuined Kingwill soon meet the victims of his curse.
Yorick_Original_Move_46.wav|yorick|en|But for the waters, the mist would take me.
Yorick_Original_Move_47.wav|yorick|en|I am the first and last of my order.
Yorick_Original_Move_48.wav|yorick|en|Do you hear that? It is the end.
Yorick_Original_Move_49.wav|yorick|en|I cling to life by the thinnest thread.
Yorick_Original_Move_5.wav|yorick|en|The Mist writhes, searching for a place to take root.
Yorick_Original_Move_50.wav|yorick|en|The dead shall forgive me. I hope.
Yorick_Original_Move_6.wav|yorick|en|It is to the grave, we go.
Yorick_Original_Move_7.wav|yorick|en|The isles were once paradise; now they're a prison.
Yorick_Original_Move_8.wav|yorick|en|This mist has become skin.
Yorick_Original_Move_9.wav|yorick|en|Life is but a brief disinterment.
Yorick_Original_Q2_0.wav|yorick|en|Join me, brother.
Yorick_Original_Q2_1.wav|yorick|en|Die with me brothers, and be free.
Yorick_Original_Q2_10.wav|yorick|en|Arise and return to this world.
Yorick_Original_Q2_11.wav|yorick|en|Walk once more.
Yorick_Original_Q2_12.wav|yorick|en|A little longer, friend, then rest.
Yorick_Original_Q2_13.wav|yorick|en|Rest in your rightful place.
Yorick_Original_Q2_14.wav|yorick|en|It's good to see you.
Yorick_Original_Q2_15.wav|yorick|en|Wake up. You have a new task.
Yorick_Original_Q2_16.wav|yorick|en|Welcome back, you won't be here long.
Yorick_Original_Q2_17.wav|yorick|en|Allies from below.
Yorick_Original_Q2_2.wav|yorick|en|Hello, friends.
Yorick_Original_Q2_3.wav|yorick|en|Some of these faces I know well.

Yorick_Original_Q2_7.wav|yorick|en|I thank you for your service.
Yorick_Original_Q2_8.wav|yorick|en|Kill, and use its form.
Yorick_Original_Q2_9.wav|yorick|en|They rise, they fight, they rot.
Yorick_Original_QAttack_Kill_0.wav|yorick|en|I shall perform your rites!
Yorick_Original_QAttack_Kill_1.wav|yorick|en|What's one more grave?!
Yorick_Original_QAttack_Kill_2.wav|yorick|en|The isles remember!
Yorick_Original_QAttack_Kill_3.wav|yorick|en|I must dig!
Yorick_Original_RRank_0.wav|yorick|en|One more step toward domination!
Yorick_Original_RRank_1.wav|yorick|en|Do you feel it? I ammore!
Yorick_Original_RRank_2.wav|yorick|en|We feed, we grow!
Yorick_Original_RRank_3.wav|yorick|en|We are stronger. We shall take all!
Yorick_Original_R_0.wav|yorick|en|Go, take what you will.
Yorick_Original_R_1.wav|yorick|en|Behold the horrors of theIsles!
Yorick_Original_R_2.wav|yorick|en|See the Maiden? She comes foryou.
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_0.wav|yorick|en|Do not resist.
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_1.wav|yorick|en|The mist takes all!
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_2.wav|yorick|en|More, more for the black maw of the mist!
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_3.wav|yorick|en|We are not corruption. We are strength!
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_4.wav|yorick|en|All will join.
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_5.wav|yorick|en|Submit. Surrender.
Yorick_Original_R_Maiden_6.wav|yorick|en|We devour it. It becomes us!

Yorick_Original_Recall_0.wav|yorick|en|Even a monk needs respite.
Yorick_Original_Recall_1.wav|yorick|en|The bells toll and I respond.
Yorick_Original_Recall_2.wav|yorick|en|We all return to our origin.
Yorick_Original_Recall_3.wav|yorick|en|My path is a circle, my work never-ending.
Yorick_Original_Recall_4.wav|yorick|en|You retreat like a coward.
Yorick_Original_Recall_5.wav|yorick|en|A breath between rites.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_0.wav|yorick|en|One day, I will no longer awaken.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_1.wav|yorick|en|When we end, we begin again.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_10.wav|yorick|en|A futile act—why do you persist?
Yorick_Original_Respawn_2.wav|yorick|en|Revived by the tears of life.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_3.wav|yorick|en|The shock of resurrection quickly passes.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_4.wav|yorick|en|We do not die, and so we fight on.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_5.wav|yorick|en|The beyond is not given. It is earned.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_6.wav|yorick|en|A fleeting repose.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_7.wav|yorick|en|There will be no requiem. Not yet.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_8.wav|yorick|en|Our time has not yet come.
Yorick_Original_Respawn_9.wav|yorick|en|I've come too far to stay dead.

Yorick_Original_TauntResponse_2.wav|yorick|en|I'm just happy to have company.
Yorick_Original_TauntResponse_3.wav|yorick|en|Ah yes, I remember spewing idle words.
Yorick_Original_Taunt_0.wav|yorick|en|You'll make a fine addition to my cloak.
Yorick_Original_Taunt_1.wav|yorick|en|For you, I won't dig too deep.
Yorick_Original_UseItemPotion_0.wav|yorick|en|To delay the end.
Yorick_Original_UseItemPotion_1.wav|yorick|en|I still draw breath.
