I'd keep my head down if I were you.
Strike from the sky.
Just like hunting thresher geese.
Look Val, snacks.
Still heart, steady aim.
You get the next one, Val.
Flush 'em out.
Fly swiftly... kill swiftly.
I'll follow your lead, Valor.
Stay on the target.
Who's there? Fiora who? Valor, that's just mean!
Who's there? Jarvan who? Uh, Valor!
Who's there? Garen who? Yeah, I guess he does say that a lot.
Sometimes I swear that bird is just showing off.
Val's stealing all the glory again.
Demacia needs heroes.
We Elves are not easy prey
A bird's eye view is the best advantage.
There's always a trail.
We've got this covered.
Demacia is counting on us.
Buy me some time.
Find me a path.
Stick to the plan, Val.
We're in this together.
I live behind enemy lines.
Gouge 'em, Valor!
Go for the eyes!
Now!
Valor, to me!
I'd keep my head down if I were you.
I've got friends in high places.
Valor's shadow is the last thing you'll see.
Need eyes on 'em!
Eyes in the sky.
What do you see up there?
Justice takes wing.
