wavs/audio_0001.wav|I won't be denied!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Trample them!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|I was born for conquest.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Leave no survivors.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Die with weapon in hand.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I rule the Freljord.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|I was forged by winter.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|They will feed my boar.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Seize what's ours.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Show them our teeth.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Bristle, attack!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I won't be denied!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Run them down!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Easy, Bristle. The archer's mine.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Which will snap more easily? The bow, or you?
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Ice Witch, prepare to be shattered!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Are icicles the best you can muster?
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Can you smell 'coward', Bristle? Get 'em!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Who wants a treat? Bristle wants a treat? Not until we've trampled our foes to dust!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|We settle this, here, and now!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|We fight while cowards talk.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I will rule the Freljord.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Bristle seems hungry today...
wavs/audio_0024.wav|There is no strength in servitude.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|We bow to no one!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You own what you take.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Ride onward!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Fight or make room for those who will.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|No spoils for the meek.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I will not hide behind another shield.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Pain is nothing.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Living in fear is not living at all.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|A gift from the Freljord!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|There's no use running!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Flee like the cowards you are!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Those who oppose me get gored.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Don't worry, Bristle, I'll leave you the scraps.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Die!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Trust nothing but your strength.
