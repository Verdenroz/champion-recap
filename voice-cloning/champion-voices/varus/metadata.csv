wavs/audio_0001.wav|I have no grace to give.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Your body will stain the earth.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Vengeance unbound.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|No time to regret.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Too late to atone!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|My blight devours!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You are to blame!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Undo all that is good.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Death and decay!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Grovel.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Your punishment.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Rot!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Blood for my kin.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I do not forgive!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Your will decays!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Even hope will perish.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Despair finds its mark.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Know my torment.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Beg for your life!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Valmar, Kai... I...
wavs/audio_0022.wav|No...! Humans die...
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Break!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Writhe!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Yield!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Aatrox, brother, the double 'A' thing is absurd and you know it.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|A sword has no reach, brother—no aim.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Ascended, your sun-born greatness meets a dark demise.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|'Warmother', Ashe? You are a child, unworthy of the bow.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|We were once immortal brothers, sisters, dark kin! Now, we are disgraced.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Lady of vengeance—you should side with me.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Karma, I've made a monster of your people.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Rhaast, control yourself. You make the rest of us look foolish, brother.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Rhaast. Perhaps we should warn our siblings about... Ionian vessels.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Hounds, Naafiri? You make me grateful formyvessels.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|You wish unity for us, sister. Can this be realized in battle?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|That blade felled my kin once, Sivir. Never again.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Pray you fall swiftly. Every cut will be anguish.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You may run, but you will not be spared.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|No plea for mercy will stay my hand.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Brave enough to oppose me; fool enough to die.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Pride will not save you. Learn to obey...
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Such idiocy begs to be silenced by my arrow.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Perhaps you deserve oblivion, brother.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Iam the bow, Ashe.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|The first of many.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|A taste of bloodshed.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Let this be a warning to the rest.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|There is no revenge but mine, Kalista.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You'll save neither yourself, nor your people, Karma.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Rhaast, find two vessels next time—trust me.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|The pack cursed you, sister. It only created more targets.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Slaughteris the right of my bow and my blood!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Sivir—your bones and blade will turn to dust.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Let corruption seep in.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Death does not absolve you.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Corrupted and cut down.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|The fate of those who defy me.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|None escape my aim.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|One arrow to finish everything.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|The life in your eyes wanes.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You will die faster than you could run.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Your long-overdue end.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|A small piece of a greater retribution.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Speak your regrets to the dirt.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Breathe your last; feel every wound.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Varus laughs slyly.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Varus hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|This form must not fail...
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Varus hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Naafiri, you claim unity is power. Power within me—and against our enemies. Let us see, together.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Every step forward...
wavs/audio_0073.wav|A battle nears.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Many stand against us.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Which burns brighter—the fire of retribution, or the heart's light?
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I aim to save my people!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|What strength do you cling to, sons of Ionia?
wavs/audio_0078.wav|What use is mercy?
wavs/audio_0079.wav|This bow is a heavy burden...
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Until the end.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Noxus wronged me!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|We'll walk together again...
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Are these the fields, of home?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|We were all warriors.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Varus, you were once human.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|You dove into my prison, humans. Drown with me...
wavs/audio_0087.wav|What are the Darkin?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Valeeva, Xolaani, Naafiri. What unique ambitions you have, my sisters.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Mortals once used me to confront the Darkin. I see no greater war than facing my brethren.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|If you must speak, humans: let your voices be the howl of arrows.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|No peace will endure once I find my fellow Darkin.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Valmar and Kai urge redemption... Is it so beyond me?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Valmar. Join me in retribution.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I faced terrors... Until I became one.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I will bury the world that buried me.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|My hosts dwell on a humanity long gone...
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Grieve for the lost.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Fight for refuge!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|The magic that sealed me became my blight.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Archers shoot to kill.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|We've fallen so far...
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Forgiveness takes nothing!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Compassion... is but a whisper.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I need not humanity.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Darkin, or human... I was always a weapon.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|An arrow should not question its course.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|War must quiet my mind...
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Spite drives me.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|You walk a dark path, Varus.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|My kin will scourge this world!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Vengenace is power!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|No heart binds me!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|A land of riddled bodies marks my return.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Your tormentors are gone...
wavs/audio_0115.wav|They will die where they stand.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|All I see, all within reach.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Corrupt, control.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|SUFFER!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|GIVE IN!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|FALL!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|In quiet moments, I see the memories of Darkin and men...
wavs/audio_0122.wav|A moment of rest—before the massacre resumes.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Enjoy this respite, sons of Ionia. It will not last.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|This calm is nothing compared to the deathly stillness I will bring.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|The cries of the guilty will fill the air.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Valmar, Kai—donotdivide my focus.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|So long as this bow remains, I live.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Pardon them...
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I am Darkin. Even death itself will not stop me!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Another chance to choose peace...
wavs/audio_0131.wav|We're alive...!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Spite and pain await you!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Weak posturing for someone soon to crumble.
