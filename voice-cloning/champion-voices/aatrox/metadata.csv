wavs/audio_0037.wav|You would rush towards me, Kai'Sa? What fool would build a strategy on that idea? Come, let us begin.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Let me show you your error, Kayle! You are not worthy of ascension! You, are not worthy of the worms!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I did not think my fellows weak, Rhaast! Already you disappoint me!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Ooh, a shadow warrior! How edgy!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I chose a sword, the noblest weapon, Rhaast. You- seriously, I don't understand… Were you trapped in the gardening section?
wavs/audio_0042.wav|A scythe? A scythe?! Are you planning on murdering fields of wheat?!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|A lightning squirrel? Thank you! Your death will amuse me!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Are you a joke, you loud, horrible thing? I shall kill youandyour steed!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Where is your head, rock thing? Where is the neck I shall sever?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Am I challenged by a tree?! Fine, let me build a pyre from you!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You would bind yourself to this realm. Morgana? Fine, let me show you the ground!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You are unloved, Mundo! Now, face judgement!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Nasus, is your wisdom enough to know your fate? I am your death!

wavs/audio_0054.wav|A bird? You would challenge me with a bird?! Come!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Renekton! In your madness, you know my suffering! Though I shall end yours.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Riven, dance, child! That broken blade is no match for me!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You would challenge me in a machine? You are a strange spirit, Rumble.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|A spirit blade, master Shen? Test it against me, let me shatter your illusions!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Yes Sion! I kill even that which will not die! I end all things!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I will find a way to tear down the heavens and reveal you as fiends! Not today obviously…
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Hail the protector! Hail Taric, aspect of- get a haircut!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Cowardly spirit, how annoying you are! I will savour killing you, Teemo!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|A troll king?! Come! Defend your throne, king of trolls!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Yes, Tryndamere! I am the cause of your suffering! See if you can cut justice from me!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Remember the screams of your kinsmen as you fall to me, Tryndamere!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Rage? You are just flesh, Tryndamere, ready for harvesting!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I wait for you, Tryndamere! Come, take your vengeance!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Varus, 'V' 'A' 'R' 'U' 'S', your name should have an 'A' and then another 'A', Varus. There was a memo, Varus, there was a memo!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|We all agreed on the double 'A' thing, Varus. The double 'A' thing!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You would end worlds? As a bow?!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I will not send you to death, Yorick! I bring oblivion!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Pray, fool! You face a Darkin.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Our duel begins.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|This violence shall amuse!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Come, fight me!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Do you see my edge?! Your death awaits!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Come closer! I will show you… darkness!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I am like a demon, but more edgy, right? You know, cause I'm a sword. Hmm…
wavs/audio_0079.wav|So uh, I'm Aatrox. I'm a transcendental being trapped inside cutlery… What's your deal?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Uh, nice world you have here. I intend to destroy it, you know,FYI.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I do not need to show my mastery, it is self-evident.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Resurrection, an endless cycle of life… A dead bird.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|What foolish plan bore a woman such as you, Camille? You were a folly, crafted by an idiot.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The axe suited you, Darius, the weapon of a simpleton!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I expected you to be nimble, Fiora. Too easily, my blade crushed your spine.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Yo ho, Gangplank, yo ho.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Demacia! Whatever 'Demacia' is, I will slay it next!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|In time I will learn how to kill even your god, Illaoi!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I cannot know if I was corrupted by the void, but at least my choices were not asinine.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Die, Kayle, knowing your potential will never be reached.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I cannot have brotherhood with incompetence.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|What is property? Why did this dead hamster want me off of it?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I kill mountains, Malphite! Dumb piles of rocks!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Hear me, tree spirit. Your form is but kindling, and your forests I will burn!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|You disgust me, Morgana. Die in the filth of your bound flesh!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Journey back to the deep!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Ornn, like all gods, you disappoint!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Pantheon, you crawl forward like a worm! Ready to be squashed again?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Now your body matches your blade, Riven: broken and worthless!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Die, Shen, knowing the Eye of the Twilight is blinded and plucked.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|You fought to live, Sion, yet it is I who am still alive. This at least amuses.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Lord of starlight, lord of hair! I trample on your corpse, Taric! I spit on your aspect's purpose!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|A spirit for cowards, I laugh at your tricks and mushrooms!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I thought you my next vessel, Tryndamere. Pity, you failed even to become a slave.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Honestly, a bow and two boys? What was your plan, Varus?
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Return again to your prison, Varus. Think upon your worthlessness!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|How I loathe your freedom, trickster! I will take this vengeance upon you, until the end of times!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I will have silence.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I sing only in your deaths.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|This is the silence I seek.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|This was reckoning.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|This is your absolution.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Resurrect! Return! So I may kill you again…
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I brought you the one true gift, I brought you… death!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|This is my gift to mortals.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Carnage, my last joy.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|You die… a fool.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Your broken form speaks only of failure.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|To the end of times, I shall kill you again and again.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Mastery? I must congratulate you, obviously your parents never had reason to.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Yes, your mastery is the master of masters! I am fighting… an imbecile…
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Mastery, how I idolise your greatness! Though I suspect your weapon lacks… impact.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Somehow, I doubt you've mastered self-esteem.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Ah, mastery, well done! Now master your insignificance.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Targon sends an aspect against me? Prepare yourself, Pantheon, I will end all that you hope to be!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Pantheon! I will crush your godhood, I will eviscerate your ideals, even your memory… I will trample!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|How far I have fallen! A god… reduced to a prisoner!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|See what beasts they have reduced us to… Creatures of flesh sustained only by this filth's blood and form!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I have no goodness left, it was taken from me, stolen! I… am the nemesis of life.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|From entire villages and towns, I will rend the flesh… Until I stand… as an unholy god.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Let me tear their flesh from them. Let me break their souls… And murder their dreams.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|The heavens, the endless skies folding into each other. Where are they now?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I shall regard their cries as braying steeds, waiting to be whipped, broken, and bridled!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I do not obey! I cannot lay down! I will be the ender of all things!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I am in a cage within a prison… But thisfoulshape reminds me of my purpose!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Dark deeds I will do this day… Though I will carry myself as my former pride dictates!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Every dream is a candle I must snuff out… I… am the darkness…
wavs/audio_0138.wav|They sing of love, hope and gods, all that makes them want to live! So, I will quiet that first!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Carnage, hate, yes! I am the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Behold, the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Bow worms! Bow before the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|See your World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Insects, the World-Ender has come!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Take everything from them! Become the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Death to all! The World-Ender awaits!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Now, I am the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|I bring silence! I am the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|"""This is the time, the World-Ender is here!"
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Quiet yourselves, the World-Ender is here!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I am Aatrox, I am the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|There is no escape from the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|I am ready to be the World-Ender!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|The true sound of my blade can only be heard when they loathe re-incarnation.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|The only peace I seek… is death!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed… Noble is this carnage.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|I will drown them in oceans of blood!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I will snuff out the light, I shall make darkness eternal!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|I am oblivion, I am destruction… I am doom.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|I march to death… Though I wish it was my own…
wavs/audio_0161.wav|My suffering… I will make it bloom.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|I must destroy even hope.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|I will render these mortals' forms into my own!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Gods and mortals, they deserve only death!
wavs/audio_0165.wav|They will call me villain… Come, let me earn their hatred, again and forever.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|As long as this form lives, I will punish them.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|I stood against the void. Now… I would welcome it.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|This cursed form… This crude decaying flesh! I loathe it!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|I am your reckoner, mortals.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Let them lament… my name.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|They will call me a god killer!
wavs/audio_0172.wav|He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Kneel mortals! So I may split your shoulders from your spine!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|I am not a king, I am not a god, I am… worse…
wavs/audio_0175.wav|We had another name once… Now, we are Darkin.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Peace is a lie, there is only passion…
wavs/audio_0177.wav|I am doom!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|My darkness was not born, it was forged by my prison.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|All that lives, I will end!
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Those who call me enemy, I welcome them.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|I cannot die… until all life ends.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|There is a darkness in my heart deeper than any shadow!
wavs/audio_0183.wav|March toward vengeance… Drown this world in blood!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Patience, Aatrox! Patience! Your freedom will come!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Their screams will be like the soothing hum of insects at dusk.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|For my imprisonment, they will suffer!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Challenge me, mortals! I am here!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows…
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Follow me into destruction!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|I offer you victory!
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Fight! Or be forgotten!
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Become… hate!
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Let blood be our sacrament!
wavs/audio_0194.wav|My will… is beyond death!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|I am Darkin! I do not die!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Behold, immortality!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|You think you can kill me?
wavs/audio_0198.wav|I… amnota mortal!
wavs/audio_0199.wav|As long as life exists, as long as time has meaning, I am not done!
wavs/audio_0200.wav|I return!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Did you think you could killme?!
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Nothing can kill me!
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Insects, you think you can kill me? Behold my curse!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|You cannot destroy me!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Yes! Fight me!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Ido notdie!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Now, hear the silence of annihilation!
