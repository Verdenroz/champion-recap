wavs/audio_0001.wav|Your reckoning will come either way.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|In the end, they all scream!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Protect what is pure.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I refuse to wilt.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Life torn from your grasp.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|It is in my nature.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|The blessed waters turn within me.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I will sow fear.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|There is rot within!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|I'll show you 'twisted'!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Rooted out.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|The trees have learned violence.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|So much life, stolen!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Bones break before branches.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Vengeance may be hollow, but so is my trunk!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|It is good to ungnarl my limbs.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Your life bloom fades!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|You defile the grove!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Madness!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|To find life, I will snuff yours out.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Where men fall, saplings rise!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|This power is mine to command.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|How my branches groan!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Once this land knew solitude.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Life feeds on death!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Torment at your peril.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I wondered what happened to that tree.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I do tend to punch things.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|From a land where the trees are hardy and tall... and very, very cold.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|To strike a blow for nature.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Burn through the Mist.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Is it woven from branches? I can never tell.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Restoring life.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|To aid the waters within my wood.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Flee, my saplings...
wavs/audio_0036.wav|The forest...
wavs/audio_0037.wav|To the soil...
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Away, my sapling.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Seek the forest's foes.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Give them room to spread their leaves!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Patient as a tree.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|One with nature.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Greenfather, my sapling wishes to meet you.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|The Greenfather spreads life. The Mist will end it.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Careful, my sapling. Ivern is watching.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Does this make you uncomfortable, Bramblefoot?
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I'd like you more if youwerea fox.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You create only destruction, Star Forger.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|An axe is no danger if I cut you down first!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You make me glad I don't have ears.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Strength starts in the roots—and you have none.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Oh, what mortals will do for beauty. Kill, and wear pointy shoes.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Stop putting web in my branches!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I hear your skittering, mortal.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|You give sticks a bad name—and fiddles too!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Stop carving words into my bark! Everyone knowsG <3 K!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Demacia's walls will not stop the Black Mist.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|One of many shadows on the Isles. The Shadow of War.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Trample that blade of grass, horseman. I dare you.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Only men seek redemption.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Make like a tree and vacate the area.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Kill them withkindness?
wavs/audio_0063.wav|The sapling of the god Willow.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|A voice follows this one! A song, like those in the Mist!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|It is the Isles that were betrayed!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Spirit of vengeance? And what of the forest?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|The saplings wish to hear your dirge. Please, sing it... while Idestroyyou!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|The song of life, now silent.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You make me glad I don't have ears.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I am no abomination!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|The forest clings to life, and you would end it!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I am no abomination!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|The forest clings to life, and you would end it!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Magic came from nature, and will return to nature.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Another pile of bones wearing a crown.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Rival tothe Ruined King—in ruin.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Darkness gathers on the Isles—from every depth.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Beware the mortals' gifts.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|To bleed the bloodless.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Come and meet your end—and... a sapling or two.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Your existence was not meant to be.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|There is still life enough within me to grant you death.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|You make me glad I don't have ears.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|A lantern? Ha! The forest is very dark indeed.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|It is torture enough being near you, spirit.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|The soul of the Isles is lost—beyond your grasp.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Yordle... Stay out of my trunk!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|The Isles have forgotten more than just your name.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|So you're what passes for a hero among the fleshlings?
wavs/audio_0090.wav|You would scour the Isles without planting a seed.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Have you ever tried to dig through roots? Good luck, human.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|A dangerous bloom, that one.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|It was a mistake to become human. You will share their doom.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|You forgot your roots!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I love all my saplings—especially how they taste.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|The circle of life starts withdeath!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|If only the humans were vegetarians.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Mortal to the end.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|A friend of the forest no more.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Begone, vile spirit!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|The Isles will be cleansed!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Another shadow.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|To rest, if only you could.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Mortals? Hmph.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|You would fight the forest in the forest?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Mortals always invading.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Blood makes the grass grow.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I would end your burden, but it always returns.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Wood knocks back!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Vengeance bears the sweetest fruit.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Enough bark, and there's no need for a bite.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Life can come back, once the earth is turned.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Hold tight, my sapling.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Beset by spirits, my home laid to waste!... And they callmetwisted.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|The water of life succumbed to death. The mortals will follow.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|The green in these plants, it is something I have lost.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I can watch the mortals doom themselves from here.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|The young sprouts beneath my feet... they tremble.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Nature conceals darkness.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Once more into the grass.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|There is life still untouched by the Mist.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Human nature? Pah!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Fight for the saplings!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Every step, defiance!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I cannot stop—the forest needs me.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|We must pull up our roots; darkness corrupts the land.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Reckless mortals!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I will fight for every pebble, every blade of grass.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Living or dead, they are all the same.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|The idol is over.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|The Mist haunts my every move, yet I resist.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Once they were human. Now, they are only in my way.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Life here existed in a time before death.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Drink deep of what magic remains.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Now, where did I put that sapling...?
wavs/audio_0142.wav|They trample life! I will trample them!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I will show them what was lost in theRuination.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Once my limbs reached for the sky, now for nearest mortal neck!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|A shadow has fallen, as men have fallen.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I cannot find peace! Not even in the smallest branch!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|I once had peace. It is better to have purpose!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|There is beauty here, even now, in the human's fear.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Stillness is not peace! It is death!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I do nature's bidding... to the very end.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|If I am already lost, I will take them with me.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Flee into the forest? Iamthe forest.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Mortals irritate me, like an itch beneath my bark.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I will punish their wickedness.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|What have you wrought, mortals? What have I?
wavs/audio_0156.wav|My heartwood is pure.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|I will end this misuse of magic!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Stand back!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|This will leave splinters!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Lashing roots!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Wretched souls!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Fools!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Uprooted.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|The grove beckons.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Hope blooms anew.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|The maelstrom has not ended!
wavs/audio_0170.wav|I rage against this curse!
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Didn't even notch my trunk.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Another blade stuck in my bark.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|In the end, darkness destroys itself.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|I am nothing like you! I can't be!
wavs/audio_0175.wav|For the forest to bloom, I will tolerate your presence.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Impressive words—but I'm a tree. I don't care.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|No.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Silence, mortal. You only give voice to darkness.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|The seeds of your destruction!
wavs/audio_0180.wav|The sapling does not fall far from the treant!
wavs/audio_0181.wav|If a human screams in the forest, will anyone hear it?
wavs/audio_0182.wav|The Isles will bloom again!
