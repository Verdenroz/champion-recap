wavs/audio_0015.wav|Thisismercy in Bilgewater!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Blade to bone, that's the way.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Feed 'em their fingers.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|One slash, ear to ear.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Toss 'em to the sharks.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Dead men tellmytale.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Killing's the only way to survive.

wavs/audio_0024.wav|This is a flayin' tool.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|This blade's got bite!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Sharp enough to etch bone.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|A dirty blade for a dirty job.

wavs/audio_0042.wav|More powder!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Burn!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You will never have a grave, Graves... see, it's 'cause your name, it's... your name is like a grave, it's — I — never mind.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|You talk a lot for a dead man, Graves.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Only thing worse than a traitor is a bad shot.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I don't need a good hand to see your fate.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|They're not just oranges. They'rebloodoranges.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I'm back at the helm.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Yar ha har argh! — (coughs) — Had something in my throat.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I've got it this time!

wavs/audio_0056.wav|I don't leave anything to fortune any more.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Can't wear the crown till the king's dead, little girl.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Maybe your cards will mourn you.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|The seafloor is littered with your ilk, gambler.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Sealed your fate when you crossed me, boy.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|They took my ship, I'll take their lives.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|With sword and shot I'll take my island back.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|My flesh will never burn.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Never trust a bilgerat!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|A reckoning approaches.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Mercy sank with my ship.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Cruelty for all.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I'll burn it all down if I can't have it.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Betrayal stings like salt on a wound.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|A slit throat is too painless.

wavs/audio_0082.wav|I am reborn of salt and brine.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Death spit me out.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Do I look like a patient man?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|A slow death will be their reward.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Hate is a child's word.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I'll hack my way back to Bilgewater.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Scum!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Everyone pays!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Filth!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I'll hit 'em with everything!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|All cannons!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I'll rain fire upon 'em!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|They'll have reason to run!

wavs/audio_0105.wav|I'm far from done killing.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Don't get comfortable in my absence.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Come, test yourself in the fire!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The smell of powder sets my blood to boil.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Survive this, and you'll need a lot of rum.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The flames are calling.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Always watch your back.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Keep a weather eye out.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Trust nothing to chance.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|No chance!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|How they try!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Not today!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Never!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|That's better.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Needed that.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Hits the spot.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Neither the flames nor the depths could claim me.
