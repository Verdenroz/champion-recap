wavs/audio_0001.wav|You have the heart of a weakling.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|So frail.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Skulls, spines, always crunch.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Your gods fear me!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Break them open!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Truth lurks in a warm-blood's guts.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Tremble at my roar!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Your shrines will fall!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Nothing but meat.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Torn to bone!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|You cannot tame lightning.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I roar, you bow.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Storm devour you!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I am Valhir.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Rolling thunder.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Vol dusk skaar!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You cannot kill a storm.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I will not be forgotten!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Blood, hahahaha, always tastes the same.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I run. I tear!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|You mean to kill me?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Vol kau fera!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Ever-winter take you.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Weakling!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Bleed, offering!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Born... in war... I fall... in war.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I...! Do... not... die...
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Storm unleashed!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|All will crumble!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Sister. How long can you endure the ice burning in your heart?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|My sister. Together, we would harness a storm to consume the Freljord!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Your war-mothers do not know true war, Ashe.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I knew Avarosa, Ashe. Just as foolish as you.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|The heart is strong, Braum. And tastiest after battle.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Braum. You have the lip fur of a lowly cub. Half of it is milk!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Play at rage, warm-blood. I will taste the fear quivering in your guts.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|You have no power here, young witch.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|The heart of a child is untamed. Violent in its hope... cruel in its despair...
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Boy! ...And beast.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You've gone soft, brother. Too much cake.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|You emerge from your mountain cave, brother. Let us end this.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Ornn. You once denied me your weapons. Now, I no longer need them.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Brother. You have lost your strongest weapons. They wither, and decay...
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Rengar! I heard of your hunt. And I heard of your failure.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Tell me, Rengar. Do your trophies make you stronger, or do they weigh you down?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Bristle! Why do you bow to this weak-willed warm-blood?
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Hmm. You think you can be savage, Tryndamere?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|What a-what is that? A cub?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Do you have something against bears, old man?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Your gods are cowards!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|You? Such a feeble sacrifice.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Your towers will splinter like rotten teeth!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I was uprooting towns when your elders were crawling.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|The first river was a river of blood! What has my brother been telling you?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Live for a few centuries and you will try everything at least once.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|It is better than staring at dirt.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|My sister. May you return on swift wings.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Your lies feed the soil.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Another coward dies.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Ornn's blood on my claws. Surely, there was a reason... Surely, this is just...
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Oh, brother... Your forge is empty and cold.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I unmake your shrines!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Beneath this stone I sense no wild.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Down with false idols!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Nothing but rubble!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|A feast for the Earth.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Blood. The way of the land.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Such a death. Far greater than your life.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I feast on your heart.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|So must it be.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|The land will exist far longer than warm-bloods.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Their bones are ash and soil. Mine rumble with wild thunder.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Follow me and we will bring down sky!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Gods do not beg. We take what is ours!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|This ground will tremble with the first storm!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|When my brother gave them fire, they forgot the fire of their own blood.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|They call me Valhir. The Volibear. Greatstorm. My true name is mine alone.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Clouds are the storm-cloak I wrap around my fur.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Bones crunch. Blood drips. This is the way of old Vorrijaard.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|My blood is of the Vorrijaard, the land before the Freljord.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I still taste their ancestors... stuck between my teeth.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|My sisters are gods of ice and salt and ever-winter. And Ornn? A liar.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|They have forgotten the old ways. The old ways have not forgotten them.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|My land was named by a god. It cannot be renamed by a coward.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Even in a cowardly man, the heart is wild. That is why it must be eaten last.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I am Valhir of the first thunder, destroyer of the white mountain, carver of the five Fjords!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Thunder roars. Wind howls. Only fools ignore the call to battle.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Darkening clouds. An omen to those who stand against the wild!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|We are all blood of the wild.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Men speak in small words. I speak in thunder!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|My thunder shakes the foundations of the world!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Warm-bloods rose on two legs... and forgot how to run.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Hmm. I taste iron on the wind... blood.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The ursine speak for man and the wild responds.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I carve my path with blood and bone.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Ice hides the fury within.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Battle boils the blood.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Many have tried to end me. A god.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I split mountains with my roar!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|They have lost their wild. I will guide them.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|To destroy is to free.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I will unleash the Freljord.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|When the night is cruel and dark...
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Let the land thunder with my storm.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|This place has been tamed. I will untame it!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|With each step I take, the wind gathers, and the Vrestrom grows!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|What happens when old wounds heal?
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I will roar the world into stillness... so must it be.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Let the storm follow in my wake.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Once, history was writ by tooth and claw.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|The creations of mortals fail. The wild remains.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|The soil hungers for blood.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Hirnvel are sacred. Tree, soil, beast, blood!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|A thousand scars, what is one more?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I am the storm!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Vrestrom consume you!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I hear them calling Valhir. The Vrestrom answers!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Sky calls to me!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The storm gathers, and I enter sky!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Storms dance upon the soil.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|A god cannot die.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I rise, wreathed in lightning!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Whose heart calls the storm?
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Show me your baby fangs again. How dear.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Coward!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Weakling!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|A fool and his head are soon parted
wavs/audio_0128.wav|The ground is sown in blood.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Tearing flesh!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Feel the power of the wild.
