Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied.
My... that's a lot of pain.
The bigger they are, the more places you can hurt them.
You're a lot to love.
Finally! A man who can satisfy me.

Don't worry, honey, I'm open to all types.
What a magnificent creature... Let's kill it slowly!
Cold blooded. Just like me.
Not the first time I've had dragon.

Love at first sight... And last.
Scream. It makes it better.
Come on, let's see those tears.
I hope this hurts.
Ohh, yes... Cry for me, honey.
No...! Don't...! Stop...!
Ooh, you're so hot when you're hurt.
Make me feel...
Hurting is yummy.
Whimper.
Don't be shy.
Harder? Okay.
Love me.
Let me in!
Let's find your spot, love.
We're done when I'm done.
That's it...!
The more I cut away, the closer we'll get.
My pleasure, your pain.
Let me see you hurt.
Everyone's pain tastes different. What flavor is yours?
Shut up and scream.
Hey there.
Nothing personal, I just need you to suffer horribly.
Like what you see? I'll rip off your eyelids!
Yes... Yes...!
I know you're hurting, but I can't feel without this.
Beg me to stop.
Careful. I'm a biter.
They're just so... stabbable!
Hope you like it rough.
Your fear is delightful.
Enough foreplay!
Awww, you thought you were getting lucky!
Don't die wishing you'd had this.
Sealed with a kiss.
Ooh la la!
Wanna get outta here?
I can't wait to see your pain face.
Hello, love.

Why not give them something to take off?
I prefer going naked but... okay.
It's a sin to cover something so perfect.

I do like your style, Liandry, whoever you were.
Aahh, still wet with the tears of Liandry herself.
Now, they will all know true pain.

Even a lich can suffer.
The pain of a lich is eternal.

This land will become a sea of torment.
Hello, hat. Ready to feast on the pain of others?

Think of all the places this can go.
It's so... big.
Imagine what we can do with this.

One last... kiss...
I thought... we had something...
Goodbye, love...
So this... is... pain?

Ugh, I wouldn't torture you if you were the last person on earth.
What's the point of torturing you?

With infinite power comes an infinite capacity for pain.

Why don't we leave the lights on for this?

I like your style, Kench, but stay out of my territory.
So how are you, River King? I see you haven't missed a meal.

How do you kill them so slowly? You have to teach me.
Ooh, I love watching you work.

Don't worry, love. You'll join them soon.
Have I told you how your parents cried with their final breaths?

That skin looks good on you, but it would look better on my bedroom floor.
First time being tortured? Don't worry, I'll do everything.
I've had my eye on you. *giggles* Now I'm gonna rip yours out.
I'll suck every last drop of joy from your heart.
I don't really have friends. Just people I haven't eviscerated yet.

I love it when they talk dirty. 'No! Please! Stop torturing me!'
Know what else is funny? Pulling your tongue out through your neck.

No, no! Don't die yet!
Aw, playtime's over.
That was fast.
Wanna do it again?
I hate it when they don't last.
Oh well... Time to find a new toy.
Was it as good for you as it was for me? No? Too bad!
Look at me! I need to watch you go.
Ugh... I think we should break up.
Ugh... I thought you'd last longer.
Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied.
We need to talk. I want to kill other people.
That was hot.
It's okay, hun, happens to everyone.

This place is so bland. It needs a splash of red.
The moment they think they have me... *laughs* Yeah, that's what I live for.
Let's see... whose life shall I ruin today?
Oooh, so many joyful people to hurt.
Show me the man who has everything, and I'll show you my next victim.
Suffering is the meaning of life. Well...theirlives.
Don't try to tell me I'm not gorgeous.
I hurt them 'til they hurt no more.
I like the happy ones. They have so much farther to fall.
Hate and love are just two words for passion.
I can't feel anything... until they do.
Ah, how their screams make me tingle.
I don't break hearts. I just tear them from rib cages.
Every kill is just a lover who didn't work out.
People have too many emotions. What am I supposed to do with  ?
♪ Rend their flesh, flay them head to toe. ♪
This craving will soon be sated.
Through suffering they come to love me. Every. Single. One.
Keep them longing, make them plead.
Once I was overwhelmed by the agony. Now I can't get enough.
Let's see... something to fill the emptiness...
Just looking for that special someone to torment.
I remember when just a little pain did the trick.
They love to watch me leave.
You really don't know someone 'til you've seen them beg for mercy.
Someday they'll love me for who I really am.
One touch, with desire... that's all I need.
I was born of a thousand screams. What's one more?
Who does a girl have to kill to start another Rune War?
The height of their happiness is the depth of their pain.
My love cuts to the quick.
Their mouths say no, but their bodies say
They're all my favorites... until they break.
I only do one night stands.
A man once told me to put on some clothes. So I wore his skin.
Human. Agony. My two favorite words.
I use every part of their torment. Nothing is wasted.
Drink the pain, toss away the rest.
These curves are real.
Without pain, how could we know joy?
I tasted peace once. Didn't do it for me.
Hate? No! I hurt them out of love.
I feel their looks like hot breath. They feel my claws like hot knives.
Need to find me? Just follow the trail of widows.
Always dress like you're seducing your next victim.
All my exes are dead.
Every smile is just a frown waiting to be turned upside down.

They all look the same in the dark.
Let's play hard to get.
It's better in the dark.
The night is my veil.
Lights out.
What they don't know won't hurt them... yet.
Oooh, I like to watch.
Let's sneak around.
The things we whisper in the dark.
They can touch, but they can't look.
Stalk and seduce.
Play more later?
Don't go anywhere.
I'm not done yet.
Not yet, honey.
Wait for me, sweetie.
Stay right there, love.
Be right back. Gotta put my face on.
Show's over, boys.
Always leave them wanting more.
Mind if I slip into something a little more... painful?
A girl's gotta know when to disappear.
Love 'em and leave 'em.

So, they like it rough.
Guess who's back for more?~
Okay. My turn.
Ugh, dying is such a turn-off.

Pfft, pillow talk.
Naughty, naughty. That gets you a lashing.

How 'bout a kiss?
You need to relax.
Let Evelynn take over.
That's it, love. Let your guard down.
The things I'm going to do to you.
Ooh, are you lonely? I can help.
Go on, touch me.
A little bit of heaven, before the hell.
You know you want me.
