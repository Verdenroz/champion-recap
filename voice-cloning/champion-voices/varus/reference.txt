I have no grace to give.
Your body will stain the earth.
Vengeance unbound.
No time to regret.
Too late to atone!
My blight devours!
You are to blame!
Undo all that is good.
Death and decay!
Grovel.
Your punishment.
Rot!
Blood for my kin.
I do not forgive!
Your will decays!
Even hope will perish.
Despair finds its mark.
Know my torment.
Beg for your life!

Valmar, Kai... I...
No...! Humans die...
Break!
Writhe!
Yield!
Aatrox, brother, the double 'A' thing is absurd and you know it.
A sword has no reach, brother—no aim.
Ascended, your sun-born greatness meets a dark demise.
'Warmother', Ashe? You are a child, unworthy of the bow.
We were once immortal brothers, sisters, dark kin! Now, we are disgraced.
Lady of vengeance—you should side with me.
Karma, I've made a monster of your people.
Rhaast, control yourself. You make the rest of us look foolish, brother.
Rhaast. Perhaps we should warn our siblings about... Ionian vessels.
Hounds, Naafiri? You make me grateful formyvessels.
You wish unity for us, sister. Can this be realized in battle?
That blade felled my kin once, Sivir. Never again.
Pray you fall swiftly. Every cut will be anguish.
You may run, but you will not be spared.
No plea for mercy will stay my hand.
Brave enough to oppose me; fool enough to die.
Pride will not save you. Learn to obey...
Such idiocy begs to be silenced by my arrow.
Perhaps you deserve oblivion, brother.
Iam the bow, Ashe.
The first of many.
A taste of bloodshed.
Let this be a warning to the rest.
There is no revenge but mine, Kalista.
You'll save neither yourself, nor your people, Karma.
Rhaast, find two vessels next time—trust me.
The pack cursed you, sister. It only created more targets.
Slaughteris the right of my bow and my blood!
Sivir—your bones and blade will turn to dust.
Let corruption seep in.
Death does not absolve you.
Corrupted and cut down.
The fate of those who defy me.
None escape my aim.
One arrow to finish everything.
The life in your eyes wanes.
You will die faster than you could run.
Your long-overdue end.
A small piece of a greater retribution.
Speak your regrets to the dirt.
Breathe your last; feel every wound.
Varus laughs slyly.
Varus hyperventilates.
This form must not fail...
Varus hyperventilates.
Naafiri, you claim unity is power. Power within me—and against our enemies. Let us see, together.
Every step forward...
A battle nears.
Many stand against us.
Which burns brighter—the fire of retribution, or the heart's light?
I aim to save my people!
What strength do you cling to, sons of Ionia?
What use is mercy?
This bow is a heavy burden...
Until the end.
Noxus wronged me!
We'll walk together again...
Are these the fields, of home?
We were all warriors.
Varus, you were once human.
You dove into my prison, humans. Drown with me...
What are the Darkin?
Valeeva, Xolaani, Naafiri. What unique ambitions you have, my sisters.
Mortals once used me to confront the Darkin. I see no greater war than facing my brethren.
If you must speak, humans: let your voices be the howl of arrows.
No peace will endure once I find my fellow Darkin.
Valmar and Kai urge redemption... Is it so beyond me?
Valmar. Join me in retribution.
I faced terrors... Until I became one.
I will bury the world that buried me.
My hosts dwell on a humanity long gone...
Grieve for the lost.
Fight for refuge!
The magic that sealed me became my blight.
Archers shoot to kill.
We've fallen so far...
Forgiveness takes nothing!
Compassion... is but a whisper.
I need not humanity.
Darkin, or human... I was always a weapon.
An arrow should not question its course.
War must quiet my mind...
Spite drives me.
You walk a dark path, Varus.
My kin will scourge this world!
Vengenace is power!
No heart binds me!
A land of riddled bodies marks my return.
Your tormentors are gone...
They will die where they stand.
All I see, all within reach.
Corrupt, control.
SUFFER!
GIVE IN!
FALL!
In quiet moments, I see the memories of Darkin and men...
A moment of rest—before the massacre resumes.
Enjoy this respite, sons of Ionia. It will not last.
This calm is nothing compared to the deathly stillness I will bring.
The cries of the guilty will fill the air.
Valmar, Kai—donotdivide my focus.
So long as this bow remains, I live.
Pardon them...
I am Darkin. Even death itself will not stop me!
Another chance to choose peace...
We're alive...!
Spite and pain await you!
Weak posturing for someone soon to crumble.
