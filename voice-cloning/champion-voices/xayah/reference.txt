Fine, I'll just be over here… sharpening my feathers.
All out of second chances. Sorry.
My last nerve is long gone.
Dance like your life depends on it.
Hmm, what shall I cut off?
Baasi kommu yu-teha.
Keep up!
Threading the needle.
I leave nasty scars.
Okay, so we're doing this.
A thousand cuts is only the beginning.
This is how I deal with unwanted attention.
This was our world first.
A dance with me ends in blood.
This is a preemptive 'No'.
Listening. Such a simple concept.
Dance.
Yay, someone to throw knives at.
Hear. My. Words!
I don't speak compromise.
Quit crying! It's just a feather.
It's only a little prick.
Ever been stabbed by a feather?
My feathers are priceless.
Move your feet, or lose some toes.
Violence is my favorite form of negotiation.
Cut by a feather? So delicate.
Sul alesh!
A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift.
When I dance, I lead.
Compromise. It's a pain.
They make chaos dance.
Call me cute again.
I always find a weak spot.
What the heck? I deserve it.
This is overpriced, but I must have it.
Hook me up with that magical creature discount?
Do I really need this? Ah… yes.
Is this ethically sourced?
I want to buy all the things!
I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge.
Where did you get all these wonderful things?
But how much does it cost for me?
I am totally pulling this off.
Play it safe!
You okay?
With what?
Honey, what are you doing?
A nice dinner?
That's not what—
Do you remember the plan?
Really? What is it?
Yeah, so?
Show them the dance.
I'm a little busy!
Baby, what did I tell you?
Close enough.
Yeah, gross.
I saw you. Everyone can see you.
You want to start it off?
Really, darling?
Now's not the time, darling.
Hi.
Are you?
Until we are free. Until magic is free.
Do you remember our escape route?
I'll take that as a no.
We'll still be alive!
Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!
You used the secret call! Is everything alright?
Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just… go that way!
That's right, babe.
Look sharp, baby.
I would never be whole again.
The best.
There's a surprise.
Will you?
You! You can know these things!
Are you having fun over there?
It's the same fight!
You're doing this!
I hate everyone today!
Not you, baby.
Only if we want to have fun.
One of them!
This reminds me of our first dates!
Mind if I cut in, Rakan?
I have your back!
I couldn't miss it!
Make them remember!
Let's show 'em what we got.
You know I do!
It is now!
I can think of something.
Can we talk about this later?
You're cute today!
Rakan is very enthusiastic.
I adore your energy.
Not a single one.
Use your words!
How long since we last danced?
Bunch of weirdos.
All of them!
Ah, it was nothing.
No. That was me.
Me. I'm counting.
Couldn't have done it without you, mieli.
Well. I'll have to do it more often, then.
Probably, but there are two of us.
I love killing for you.
Rakan, let's not gloat. Much.
They deserved it.
They aren't made like us.
That was a Vastayan farewell.
I was trying to have a moment, Rakan.
Nice job, babe.
Only you can, Rakan.
Yeah?
Keep them distracted.
I'm fine.
It has to be done.
You forgot the plan.
You remember the Aphae waterfall?
I'd like to go there again.
Yes?
What the hell were you thinking?
Yes.
They're too busy building things.
Because… they're afraid.
For what?
Okay, last time, it was totally my fault.
Good answer.
Ask me again tomorrow.
Not now!
Another road, another horizon.
We can do this.
What we have is greater than some human word.
It's lovely.
Ugh, what's with the accent?
No. No, I do not.
If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?
No, that's not whistling.
If you don't want to do this…
You're only here because of me.
Shoes.
Yes… but say it anyway.
'cause then… I wouldn't get to hear you ask.
We must keep moving.
Think, or know?
I'm so tired…
Everyone is depending on me.
I would… burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever.
I think scars are sexy.
Where do we go?
More than yesterday, less than tomorrow.
Do I make you happy, Rakan?
I'm lucky to have you.
I swear, you will be the death of me.
Me too.
Baasi sur ma-vae!
If we get separated, I'll find you.
You're already wandering off.
Why, thank you, darling.
I need you to be more careful.
Stick to the plan.
We always have a plan.
Ugh, I hate everyone today.
Murdering everyone!
You… have a plan?
That's the opposite of a plan.
It has to be done.
Like you can talk.
If things go wrong…
They don'talwaysgo wrong.
Theymostlygo wrong.
Are you pretending to be dumb?
Soon, baby. Slow down.
Nice to unmeet you.
Why now?
I think we're supposed to laugh, now?
Smile and nod, honey.
Alright!
Dust it off!
Aw, yeah, let's get down!
Aw, yeah, come on!
Get down with me!
Alright, put your back in to it!
Aw… crap…
Seriously..?
Rakan…
Ugh, lame…
Uh, seriously..?
Ugh, lame…
Oops, your bad!
Nuh uh!
Pinned!
Nope!
Sit down!
Gotcha.
Eat it!
Oops, your bad.
Didn't see that coming?
Gotcha!
Nope!
Gotcha!
Nope!
You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl.
You betray your heritage, Ahri.
Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home.
I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends.
I can't wait to burst your bubble.
Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately.
Wait, magic-powered sword legs? Is this a joke?
Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?
When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia.
Where can I get one of those delightful chthonic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag.
I want your happiness to evaporate.
I want to travel the world with you.
But is it really okay?
I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar.
Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence.
You're gross. Never change.
You call that a rebellious nature?
You call that being a vampire?
We were not made to fight each other.
Okay. Who invited the Yordle?
Yordles are the reason no one takes us Vastaya seriously.
Damnit!
Just… no.
Hahaha… I don't know what that is.
I'm not laughing. I needed to say that, just so you understand.
Behold. I am depleted of cares.
Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds.
Ha ha ha.
Too bad those tails weren't lives.
Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine.
Good henchmen are hard to find.
That was too easy, but so much fun.
Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy.
Next.
Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth.
They dropped something. Their guard.
They mindlessly marched right to their deaths. Like everyone in Noxus.
Maybe I overdid it.
I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way.
It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really.
A victory for the Vastaya.
Hurray, they all died.
I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces.
And that's where plucky optimism gets you.
Crumble! Yes!
I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done.
Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble.
Magic is again unfettered.
Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause.
We rise.
Hm, poor construction. No standards.
Shoddy construction, through and through.
Can you feel the magic flowing? I can.
They should really get a refund from those masons.
I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two.
Another Vastayan victory.
I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence.
Sabotage looks so good on me.
Untied that mystical knot.
Taitah be tervash.
Mu'takl.
We asked you to join.
It needed to be done.
This is by your design.
Shame. You could have been so useful alive.
Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste.
The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise.
Die, little inanimate spy.
And they won't be needing that any more.
Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing.
There's more than one way to blind an enemy.
Found one! Killed it.
Well, that's just an invasion of privacy.
I'm overcome with emotion.
Anyone else want to try?
Thanks for the dance.
Got what they deserved.
Yep. Easy peasy.
As far as obstacles go, that was about a… three out of ten?
And an F, for effort.
Well, that's done.
That was for the Vastaya.
Well, they tried to stop me.
I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault.
Alright, who's next?
Hmm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours.
What? They were in my way.
Few can keep up with me.
Let's cut 'em to ribbons.
Ah, silence, so golden. Like Rakan. Kind of miss him. Even if he is… noisy.
The vastaya named the world. We named the trees, the wind, the mountains. We know their power.
If love is feeling so deeply for another that you want to chew your way under their skin, then I love Rakan…
We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl. The whole place reeked of vomit, sweat and blood. It was so romantic!
They'll probably label me a war criminal one day, but not today.
The world owes the Vastaya a great debt. I'm here to collect.
I'm just an ordinary girl. An ordinary girl with an infinite supply of death quills.
Tavern brawls just seem to find me.
Nature bends towards chaos. Give in, or break.
Once, magic was everywhere, or as the Vastaya say:om upo sa't.
Ionia's meddling birthed our rebellion.
I prefer to work at night, because, y'know, the sun? Bright? Yuck!
Pandemonium follows me everywhere I go. It's like a puppy I once fed…
Nature is wild and untamed, not balanced.
Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases.
If Rakan were here, I'd make out with him until his ears bled. He loves it when I do that.
I really hate anyone who's not me… or Rakan.
Ionians never learn.
Talking to anybody about anything is never on my to-do list.
Vi-om tann va'h.
No one will block my path.
Rebellion puts the fire in my blood.
We Vastaya are only half of our full glory.
All women desire Rakan. Like they'd know what to do with him.
They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness.
I will rest when our homelands are restored.
Our Vastayan essence fades with each passing day.
Oh, I was born to ruffle feathers.
Talking to people makes me want to stab them… so I do.
If our existence is everyone else's chaos, so be it.
Chaos is the preferred state of nature.
Victors are the sole authors of history. Time to write our chapter.
Compromise issounsatisfying.
Sabotage takes patience and time… and lots of feather daggers.
I'll do whatever needs to be done… twice, just to be sure.
Sometimes people die for a good cause – namely, mine. That's why I'm an optimist.
I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand…
Cloudy days are my favorite.
Ionia used to be so nice… before humans tamed all that wild cataclysmic magic.
Humans. They're so very blind.
Spiders are my spirit animal.
Get my back!
Things are getting ugly.
I need help!
Yo! Little help.
I can't do this alone.
Hang back.
Hang back!
Look alive!
Watch out!
Eyes up!
Stay sharp!
Look alive!
Bad thing.
Danger!
Stay alert!
Babe, watch out.
I don't see 'em.
They're gone.
Enemy missing.
Can't find them.
Enemy missing.
Lost visual.
They vanished.
Stay alive!
Bringing the pain!
En route.
Here I come!
On my way.
I'm on the move.
Here I come!
Headed to ya!
I'm on the move.
Keep it together!
On my way.
On it.
You got it!
Babe, get 'em!
That one!
You want it?
Rakan, slap this fool for me!
Deal with them!
Take 'em down!
Feathers fly!
We gotta go.
Why not?
Don't leave without me!
You going somewhere?
Xayah out.
Wait for me!
Well, I'm bored.
I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where.
Bored now.
Aw, you're looking out for me!
Thank you, honey!
Thanks, babe!
Appreciate it!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet.
Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet.
Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it.
Death was a nice vacation from the tedium, but nothing good can last, I suppose.
I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit.
You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan.
If we do this right, only one of us get shot.
Get out there and take a bullet for me. Like a gentleman.
Don't embarrass me.
How am I supposed to work with— whatever this is?
Block the hits for me. Please?
Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?
I'm insulted? I don't know.
I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged.
Say that to my feathers.
Watch your tongue… and your back.
Ouch. I'm gonna need some aloe.
I can't even— I don't know where to begin.
I will punch your soul in the face.
Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood.
The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death.
Can I just hate you to death?
I'm gonna murder you a thousand times.
Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on.
I'm about to ruin your day.
Please, for the sake of us both, go far away.
Rebellions thrive on intelligence.
I never walk into a trap unprepared.
See the enemy, know their mind.
Sometimes, I have to watch my own back.
I need a strategic viewpoint.
Eyeball in the grass.
Let's have a look-see, shall we?
I must know their every move.
This is ambush territory.
I hate surprises… unless I'm doing the surprising.
Alright, get down.
Yeah, c'mere.
Aw, yeah, come on.
I can never resist an invitation to dance.
