wavs/audio_0001.wav|Gutless.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Abomination! I lay you to rest with no regret.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|This... thing has no spirit. It is empty.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|The spirits of dragons burn and roar long after they die.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|This cavern is not your home, dragon. Why defend it?
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Ribbit.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Alone, proud, feeling... hoppy?
wavs/audio_0008.wav|This form... her prison.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Let me help you, Rift Herald.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|I will put your gift to good use, protector.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Your protective nature shines through you, spirit.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I...We... live and die together as unshakable stone.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Stone-bodied, but with a living heart inside.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Hunger, gnawing, wild, wolven!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|We smell blood on the air. A feast awaits!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Mother raptor, forgive my trespass.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I feelherneed to protect the nest.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I am sorry for what I must do, Scuttler.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Scuttlers are such gentle souls.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Bare your teeth.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Try meditating.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Silence your mind.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Novice!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|No one survives life.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Struggle!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Pain brings focus.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Walk with me.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Strength of spirit!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|I sense your fear.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Fist of Hirana!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Lightning strike!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Stain my claws!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Iron jab.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I stand my ground.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Lock horns with me!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Molten flow!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|My rage runs cold.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Frozen fury.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Silence... at last...
wavs/audio_0040.wav|The frost... is melting...
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Blazing charge!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Awaken, ram!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Challenge me!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You cannot escape our inferno!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Ram spirit!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|You cannot outrun me!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Speed!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You cannot stay above it all, great Frostbringer. If the Freljord dies, it won't rise again.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|The Freljord would die in your hands, Ashe, broken beyond repair.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Thousands of spirits, screaming... silenced... warped! What are you?!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I have missed you, Lee. Let our spirits meld, let us spar.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Ice Witch, you are a blight on the Freljord! I will be its cure.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Weapons are often the tools of cowards, great forger.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Sejuani, do not make me your enemy. Please!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Arrgh! Stay out of my mind, Thousand-Pierced Bear!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Greetings are a waste of time.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I choose this fight.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Our fight will keep the Freljord alive.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Your hunger for battle is too weak to overcome me.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I am not good with people.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|We will both grow from this.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I should not have left my pelt at home.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|With your death, Ashe, the True Ice will not melt.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|A great beast has been felled... without proper rites.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|I venerate my kills. My enemies, they revel in theirs.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Thank you for refusing to strengthen my enemies!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|My most worthy and most beloved opponent.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|No peace for the Freljord!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Forgive me, Kalkia, I swore to protect your Sejuani, I...
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I close my mind to you, great Valhir!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Fallow Fox keep you.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|To take life... I do not do it lightly.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Your struggles are ended.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Balance is not always fair. I am... sorry.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|A moment of silence.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|The circle continues, unbroken, unwavering.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|The spirits at the heart of the Freljord have need of me. I answer their call.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Hear me, spirits. I pray for struggle. I pray for growth.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|I can taste our enemies' hunger for victory. Let them starve.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|The beasts I channel within me are not me, but they are mine.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Wants and needs are not the same. Wants echo. Needs howl.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The Winter's Claw remembers the beast I once was... what I nearly did...
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Kalkia helped me find myself. Lee helped me claim myself. Both good lessons.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|My power deepened after a meal from that old woman. Almost feels like a Seal Sister tale!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|War with theAvarosanswill end. Then my time, my life, will be my own again.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Sejuani'sboar, herTrue Ice, her people, her purpose... I will protect them all.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Yearsof training, and the needs of others still ring louder than my own!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Why, spirits? Why wasIchosen? For this struggle, will there ever be rest?
wavs/audio_0089.wav|For many years I thought I was cursed. I still wonder.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Ordinary lives hold beauty.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I channel the spirits I feel closest to.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I am of no tribe.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The Seal Sister blesses with water and salt.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I do not fight alone.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Demigods cannot be trusted with balance.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Animals act on instinct, not choice.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|My time inIoniataught me control.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|This life is my burden, and my land's blessing.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Creatures of the Freljord walk in the footprints of the demigods.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Peace is not balance here.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Twice I have loved, twice I have left.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Following instinct alone is no way to live.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I do not channel the demigods.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I did nottrulyknow the Freljord until I left it.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Weapons are for the weak.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Great Seal Sister, guide my steps through treacherous waters.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|TheWinter's Clawwas never my home.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|A stagnant Freljord is a dead Freljord.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Bodies are not vessels. They are anchors.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|A bear's strength is its joy. Its joy is strength.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I did not think I would like being an oathfather.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Joy and strength both crackle through me.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|A boar's true shield is not its hide, but its will.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I am an unyielding protector, with iron armor and iron will.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|The Iron Boar holds a grudge against the Fallow One.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|As it nears its goal, the ram climbs faster.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Mastery is a volcano, and I will rise within it like magma.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Struggle, challenge, growth... hm, the marrow of life.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|May we never know life without the frost.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Anger the phoenix, and feel its talons.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I enter the fray, anger in my heart and ice in my veins.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Our spark runs wild!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Awaken, bear!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Such a feast!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Lightning is not a single bolt, but a storm!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Strength!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Bear spirit!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Awaken, phoenix!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Save your tears!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Storm follow!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Frost and fury, our perfect storm!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Ice wind!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The storm rages through me!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Phoenix spirit!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Needs in the Freljord are loud. Meditations quiet my mind.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I see the world through the eyes of those I channel.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Each stance flows into the next like water.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Instinct led me one way. Training, another.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Must refocus.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Urgh, even in death, silence is brief.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Not yet, Fallow Fox.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Unshakable!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Our hide, our armor!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Awaken, boar!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|No attack can bend our iron resolve!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Armor!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Boar spirit!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Conflict feeds theFreljord.
