Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
Whoa! You're a big fella!
This should really be the hero's job.
Wow. That's a lot to hammer.
I really don't have anything against dragons.
Nothing personal, but... I need to squash you.
This guy seems nice. I feel bad about killing him.
Sorry, your majesty.
You should probably take cover.
Swinging from the heels!
Here goes everything.
You might wanna look out.
One whomp at a time.
Y-You're in my way!
Sorry about this.
Better get your guard up.
Careful, this packs a wallop.
I can do this.
No backing down.
Guess we're fighting.
Ready, hammer?
I hope this works.
You are... definitely not the hero.
Keep swinging till you hit something.
One shield for throwing, and one for holding.
A hammer for my hammer.
I'll just add it to my other hammer.
Well, two hammers are better than one.
Hmm... nice weapon. Does it come in hammer?
You smash people with it, right?
It's a little big, but I'll grow into it.
Yeah. Just like the hero would buy.
Got me some hammer accessories.
Goes great with a hammer.
Yay, more stuff!
Right in my hammer...
Don't move!
Freeze!
You. Sit!
Hold it right there!
Look out!
Move it!
Back off!
Outta' my way!
You sure you wanna do this? You don't even have a weapon.
Look at all that shiny armor. Sorry I gotta mess it up.
I'm about to hammer you in the jewels.
I don't get Yordles. Too fluffy.
A Demacian, a Noxian and a Freljordian walk into a tavern.
And the Piltie says, 'Can I own this ba--- uh, I own this bank, so...' He doesn't want anything because heownsthe bank...
The barkeep asks, 'What'll it be?'
The Demacian says, 'Uh, I'll have a wine.' No, wait, an ale! Yeah...
Then the Noxian says, 'I'll have a... a wine.' Yeah, he wants a wine.
And the Freljordian says, 'I'll drink anything, so long as--- ' Wait, hold on, let me start over.
A Noxian, a Targonian and a Piltie are robbing a bank.
The bank guy says, 'I'll give you whatever you want.'
The Noxian says, 'I'll take whatever gold you got back there.'
The Targonian says, 'Gimme' all your gemstones!'
I got lucky—you'll get me next time.
I'm running out of heroes.
I wish they'd give up trying to stop me, but I can understand their position.
They try to knock me down, but I have a low center of gravity.
Aaannd, my search continues.
Well, that wasn't the hero.
You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common.
Oh, wow, Garen, do you think you could sign my shield?
Garen, I think you might be the one!
A pleasure to fight for you, your majesty.
The hammer isn't mine, just keeping it until the real guy shows up.
I've heard a lot about this hero with a hammer, can't wait to meet him.
Not coming back 'til I find that hero.
One time I thought I found the hero... but he died.
Today's the day I find that hero.
Hmm... if I were a hero, where would I hide...?
Who knew there were so many heroes?
Sometimes you just gotta do it yourself.
Me? The hero? Nah, that's ridiculous.
Yep, it's even heavier than it looks.
If you're waiting for me to give up, you might be here a while.
Okay, I admit it. I'm lost.
Know what I could use? A cart.
The hammer does most of the work, I just swing it.
Every step is one step closer.
I sure do a lot of walking.
I hope the hero likes me.
I'm in, one-hundred-percent! That's everything, right?
Some things are too important to give up on.
Just had a thought—three pigtails!
Man, quests are hard.
I could really go for a nap.
Guess I'm going this way now.
Oh, you like to fight? So does my hammer!
What do you mean my hammer's too big?
How Demacian of you!
Donotmake my hammer mad.
I gotta see this through.
Got it.
Shieldy...
Hope it's not dented.
Left hand!
Shield to the face!
Clang!
Comin' down!
Hammer!
And stay there!
And don't come back!
Remember to roll!
Look at him go!
Huh. Didn't know I could do that.
Whoa. You went far.
Up goes the guy!
Whomp!
Wait, what did I come back for?
Anyone seen a hero around here?
Now, back to finding that hero.
That's okay. I'm playing the long game.
One thing about me: I'm not good at staying down.
Let's try that again.
This hammer has two sides. Did you want to feel the other one too?
Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
Could you maybe get out of the way? Y'know, so I don't have to flatten you.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, uh... hammer!
To the hero!
Fuel for the quest.
Alright, sneakies... I know you're out there.
...Just in case they come creeping.
Hold on...
Not like this!
Keep fighting...
Not today!
No getting through me.
Hold up!
Nope.
Uh uh.
What's the hurry?
I'm no hero—just a Yordle with a hammer.
