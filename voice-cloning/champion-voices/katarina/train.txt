Is that fear I smell?
Let's dance!
Blood for Noxus!
My pleasure.
Without mercy.
Let the bloodshed begin!
Is that fear I smell?
I can't wait.
If you run, you won't see me stab you!
Ready for trouble?
No going back.
Intriguing.
Only fools hesitate.
To the point.
Keep friends close and enemies guessing.
I've made my choice.
Never play fair.
I like it.
Next time... run.
The dance of blades.
Unmatched.
Too easy.
Come on, live a little... while you can!
Better dead than dull.
Violence solves everything.
