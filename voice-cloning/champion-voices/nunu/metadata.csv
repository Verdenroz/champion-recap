wavs/audio_0001.wav|It's okay, we'll play later.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I really... don't likemonsters!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Songs aren't usually this... scary.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Don't close your eyes, Willump! We gotta face this!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Brambleback! It was you all along! Well, your evil deeds end here!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I heard what you did inKumungu, Brambleback!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Cinders in his heart. A sure sign of evil, Willump.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Willump can't stop seeing red! What did you do to him, Brambly?
wavs/audio_0009.wav|The princess will never wake up, unless we can find a bramble rose.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Cloudy with a chance of dragon!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Why are there never any snow dragons? (Willump noises) Oh yeah, we can make one.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Lift me higher, Willump, so I can punch it in the nose!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|A real dragon?!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|One ring to rule them all.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Gah! We've been poisoned, Willump! The only cure is to kick Gromp's butt!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Think Gromp's actually a princess? (Willump noises) I'm not kissing her!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Let's Gromp it up!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|The fairy's voice was coming from over here! I bet that Gromp swallowed her!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Lord Grompulus Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth, your unjust reign ends here!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Infernal? Sounds evil to me!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|You think the Krugs turned all those people into stone? (Willump noises) There's only one way to find out!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|If you see a Krug's shadow, that means there's gonna be an earthquake.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|These Krugs don't look happy to see us... They must be up to something, Willump!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Sorry, Krugs. Willump says I gotta fight you to learn multiplicationing.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|The frost troll will never leave the village if we don't get rid of the Krugs. He's scared to step on them.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You're in a mountain of trouble!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Can't be any worse than a sea serpent!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|That old man in the cave asked us to kill exactly ten raptors. (Willump noises) I don't remember why.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|We gotta stop the raptors before they become evil raptosaurs and try and eat the sun! (Willump noises) What? It could happen.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|What a big beak you have, Mrs. Raptor. You're gonna use it to hurt people, aren't you?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Are you sure they're really raptors? Or are theyVoidmonsters in disguise? (Willump noises) Pluck their feathers, Willump!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Don't hold back, Willump! They stole this nest from those wraiths we talked to!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Stay close, Willump.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Uh-oh.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|I can do this. Huh!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Beat up a bunch of tiny goobers, then you can fight the boss!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|A stonesentinel! He must be guarding something... like a secret!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|We will banish you from this valley, rock-skin boulder-man!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Tell us what happened to the sentries, blue guy! Or someone's gonna get hurt!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|He's sucking up all the blue in the world! We gotta stop him, Willump!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Don't let them bite you, Willump, then you'll turn into a were-yeti! ...Wait, that would be awesome!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|The boy who cried wolf? That's not me! I never cry.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Murk wolves, I come to fight you in the name of your archenemies! Murk CATS!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I'm gonna play a song so loud these wolves will lose their stinky breaths trying to howl over me!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|The wolves are howling so much the moon can't sleep at night. Let's muzzle them, Willump.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Put some claw into it, Willump!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Meet my best friend, Willump!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Willump's not a monster!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Watch out for his beard! You can get tangled up in it.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Something tells me they don't want a hug.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I got your back, Willump! Woah! Almost fell off!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Fear the wrath of Svellsongur! (Willump noises) It's not a flute!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Let's kick bad guy butt! *laughs* 'Cause they never wear butt armor!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|We'llalwayswin, 'cause we have something to fight for! (Willump noises) Not princesses! Gross!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|No wonder they're so angry, they forgot to bring snowballs!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|We don't wanna hurt you.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Don't make me come down there and bonk you myself!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Clawsslash! Teethchomp!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I have sworn to vanquish all kinds of bad stuff, starting with your face!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Saving the world is so muchfun!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Mess with the yeti and you get the boy!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|It's not fighting if you're having fun!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|If we save the Freljord, everyonehasto like us!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I don't know what 'dastardly' means, but I'm gonna punch it!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Yeah! What he said!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Evildoers beware!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I learned how to fight from a song. (Willump noises) That's not weird! (Willump noises) It's cool!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|You bop and I'll boop, Willump!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Didn't anyone tell you? The bad guys never win!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|And a little ofthat! Pow!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|The best part of being a hero... is shouting out your catchphrase!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|What you're doing is wrong!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|These bad guys aren't gonna bruise themselves!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Willump! No...
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Willump! Don't leave me!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Willump! I'll save you, Willump! I'll save you! I can save you. I can...
wavs/audio_0077.wav|My mom said as long as I remember her, she'll always come back... like Anivia.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Our caravan used to race Anivia all across the Freljord!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Thevault door! I bet Ornn carved it! (Willump noises) What? That's not a spoiler!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Braum? I knew you were real! Will you be my dad?
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I can be a hero too! I'll show everyone in theFrostguard!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I hope Lissandra's not mad. Huh, her face might freeze that way.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|It's not how you die, Olaf! It's how you live! Even I know that!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Uh-oh, Willump. He's got two axes, one for each of us.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Ornn! My mom used to sing yoursongas the ashes died in the fire. It still makes me feel warm.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Sometimes fighting can teach you things... like how to forgive your brother.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Definitely not a princess.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I wanna be a barbarian when I grow up!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Believe in yourself, Tryndamere, and you won't need tocall people chickensbehind their backs.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Volibear! Uh, sorry. I mean, the Volibear. Or, uhm, Mr. The Volibear... sir...
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Why did the Frostguard cross the road? 'Cause he thought he was a— (Willump noises) *yells* Whoa! You really don't like Frostguards.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Knock knock. (Willump noises) A Frostguard! (Willump noises) W- Willump! You're not supposed to smash him!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|A Frostguard walks into a mead hall and— (Willump noises) Woah! Not again! (Willump noises) *chuckles* Joke's on me, huh, Willump?
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Speak softly and carry a big stick.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Some say, the beast's cries can still be heard whenever you taste purple.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Am I crazy, or was that monster more afraid of me?
wavs/audio_0097.wav|At first I was afraid, but then I felt... the snow became ice. What's happening, Willump?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|No flowers on this one! We gotta keep looking!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|But maybe it wasIvern'sfault.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Now there's nothing but ash... evil ash!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|You should've just said you were angry.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|And once again the village was saved, thanks to the one and onlyNunu! (Willump noises) Fine, Willump helped.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I like watching clouds, but it's even better fighting them!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|They were just defending their home. Why don't the songs ever mention that?
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Looks like we got... under his scales.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Dragonslayers! That's us.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|More like,elderlydragon!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Apologies, m'lady. We'll find a way to un-toadify you.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Phew! I've never Gromped so hard in my life!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|May the crown pass to a more worthy Croaksworth. Like Tim! Or Jerry. Or Jeff. Or, um... hm.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Fairy? Are you in there...? Whoa. Disappeared!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|That was a weird cure. I hope I read the scroll right.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Spicy! ...I said 'spicy'!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Frost troll! Your feet are safe now!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|We should go back to the village, Willump. Maybe the curse is lifted?
wavs/audio_0116.wav|That was your mistake, Krugs. We never take evil for granite.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Willump, you didn't have to shake the earth yourself.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|That's what you get for teaching numbers!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|We beat up a mountain! Woah!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Salty.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I know I should be happy, but... it feels lonely, Willump.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Oh yeah, the old man's gonna make pants out of the raptors' beaks and stuff. (Willump noises) I don't know how.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Maybe now the wraiths can come home!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|You say everything tastes like raptors.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Sun's still shining, guess that means our work is done.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|The other kids said I had a big beak once.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|High three, Willump!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Rift scuttled!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Yeah! Go back to the Void, ya crabbybutt!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|No one's the boss of me! (Willump noises) I hope Lissandra didn't hear that.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|You shouldn't abandon your best friends!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Next time you'll remember, it's not nice to keep secrets!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Sometimes blue is the only color in the Freljord. I remember my mom had blue eyes...
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Crumble under the weight of your infamy!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I'm more of a murk-yeti-kid myself.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|And though the song has ended, it echoes in our hearts!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|...I'm gonna miss those pupsters, Willump.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Oh no, you bitthem, and now they're yeti-wolves!Awooo!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Playing dead is still playing, right? (Willump noises) Oh...
wavs/audio_0140.wav|We didn't wanna hurt you, that's why we used snow.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Hurting people isn't fun, Willump. Is that why it's so hard to be a hero?
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Ooh, one too many snowballs...
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Hah... Magic tickles.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|We did it, Willump!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|You were gonna hurt someone with that!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Smell you later, bad guy!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Perfect timing! Must be from all the songs.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Woah!! *grunts* ...Ha.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Woah!!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Whoa!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Uh-oh, I think Lissandra's mad at me. (Willump noises) But I won't let her hurt you, Willump!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|It's not a flute, Willump. It's a sword, called...Svellsongur! (Willump noises) Fine, I'll stick to snowballs...
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Once upon a time, there was a yeti, and a boy. (Willump noises) But this timeIget to be the yeti!Roar!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|This way to...adventure!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Haha! Yippeeeee!!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Haha! Can't catch me!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Faster, Willump!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Woah, too fast! The snot just froze to my nose!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Whoa! This. Is. Awesome!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|We're off like a dirty tunic! (Willump noises) That's what one of the elders used to say. (Willump noises) I wonder if he's alright.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Someone out there needs our help!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Keep your eyes open for treasure. Like skulls or... rusty swords! Cool!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|This day keeps getting more bizonkerific!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I bet you three icicles I can fly, I just never jumped hard enough. (Willump noises)
wavs/audio_0165.wav|My mom's out there somewhere. (Willump noises) I can hear her, Willump, every time I go to sleep...
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Playtime'sneverover!
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Ughh, old people always doom the world, so it's up to kids to save it!
wavs/audio_0168.wav|They only hurt people 'cause there's something sad in their hearts? (Willump noises) Then I'm gonna knock it out!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|I bet we could have fun over there.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Heroes don't need hugs. (Willump noises) Okay, they're not looking now. Bring it in, you big fursnarggle!
wavs/audio_0171.wav|We gotta find out what happens next, or I can never finish our song! (Willump noises) We can't be heroes without a song.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Make way for the yeti!
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Last one there's a stinky old yeti! (Willump noises) Fine... magical too...
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Let's shake out some snow!
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Your fur's tickling me!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|It's cold. (Willump noises) I'm glad you're here, Willump.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Keep playing, Willump! No one can tell us not to! We already broke the rules with the super-megapunch!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Slow down, Willump! You're gonna cause an avalanche! BeforeIcan!
wavs/audio_0179.wav|This is just like in my favorite song! Only this time, it's about us!
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Rumble, tumble, and... uh, scrumble! (Willump noises) Willump loves to scrumble!
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Let's count our steps! Eleventy-seven and one, eleventy-seven and two...
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Don't be afraid, Willump! (Willump noises) I am not scared! (Willump noises) Maybe just a little...
wavs/audio_0183.wav|I eat heroic deeds for breakfast! (Willump noises) Willump prefersKrugs, all in one gulp... (Willump noises) Ugh.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|You know what would be fun, Willump? Everything! If you're there with me!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Do your battlecry, Willump! (Willump noises) *laughs* No, not that one!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Battle is the song I came to sing!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Willump knows the way! (Willump noises) He knows lots of stuff.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|The only thing louder than Willump's steps is his snoring!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|There's nothing to it but to do it!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|I can't pronounciate your real name! (Willump noises) Well... you can't say Nunu either.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|A snowball is never just a snowball, if you believe in magic!
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Everyone knows heroes are brave, and they hit stuff really hard! But only I know the true secret. (Willump noises) No! Not that!
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Home is that way, Willump!
wavs/audio_0194.wav|It's okay to be sad sometimes, Willump. That's how you know when you're happy!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|You can't give up if you're standing on a yeti! That's as up as it gets!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I bet, if we stayed really still, we become invisible! (Willump noises) I'll always see you, Willump.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Are we there, yeti? Hehehe, get it? (Willump noises) You're laughing on the inside, huh?
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Let's make snow tracks!
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Sometimes the world's more interesting when you close your eyes. I see... globlins! Whoa, they have warts. That's how you know they're bad guys.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Before we can save the world, first we gotta see it!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Go, team yeti!
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Let's get in there and thwack some stuff!
wavs/audio_0203.wav|The adventure continues!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Let's put the venture... inadventure!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|If you could do anything, Willump, what would you do? (Willump noises) Scratch behind your ears?! That's not an adventure!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|How many words do yetis have for 'snow'? (Willump noises) And for 'farts'? (Willump noises) I knew it!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Your steps are the rhythm! (Willump sings.) And my flute's the melody!
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Nunu and Willump to the rescue!
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Buckle your tunic, we're going in!
wavs/audio_0210.wav|TheFreljord'sgreatest heroes on our way!
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Let's bury 'em in snowballs!
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Hurry, Willump! Sounds like they're in trouble!
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Fear not, fellow adventurers!
wavs/audio_0214.wav|We're here to lend some fists!
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Yetipower!!
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Secret. Hero. Handshake! Yeah!
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Up high, Willump!
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Best friends forever!
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I missed you too, Willump!
wavs/audio_0220.wav|They lived happily ever, after all!
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Did we just die, Willump? (Willump noises) Let's do it again!
wavs/audio_0222.wav|I didn't think you were dead! I could see you breathing!
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Can't lose hope, Willump! The Freljord is counting on us!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Roaaaar!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Snowsplosion!
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Boom!
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Awesome!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|I just realized... Snowballs don't have brakes!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Here we go!
wavs/audio_0230.wav|This is gonna be the biggest snowball ever!
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Gigantulossal snowball!
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Every adventure is better with a friend!
