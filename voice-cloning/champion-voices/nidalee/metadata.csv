wavs/audio_0001.wav|You are right to fear me!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|My spear will take you down!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|This is not where you belong, beast!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Youdarethreaten my tribe?
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Let's see who is top of the food chain!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Run, and I'll give chase.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Hunter, or monster—my prey sees no difference.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|You know how this ends!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Your death will be swift.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|This is the way it must be!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|My claws cut deep!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|The wild calls!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|No scurrying!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|The chase ends.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Fresh meat!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Leave, now!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Feral strength!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I'll put you down!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|My next meal!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Easy prey!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Trespasser!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|No need to suffer!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Your marrow; my feast!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|I strike true!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Too late to run.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I've picked up another trail!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|The trespassers are next!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Ah, I can hear the wind again.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|My pack needs more!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|The prowl begins anew.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Every hunter knows that core strength is key!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Let me see the sky…
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Guide me home… Kupakaa…
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Wild-blessed!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Heart of the Pakaa!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Lifeblood!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Hunters in the sun, can miss the beasts in the shadows, K'Sante.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Claws and spears bring death; the Kindred only finish what I start!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Little firebug, our Pakiti trust you—but they are naive.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Dog beast,Iwill show you what it means to be a pack-mother!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Love takes as many shapes as you do, Neeko.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|I will chase you from this land, brass-bones!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|How long can you survive outside your golden palace, princess?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I sparenoKiilash, Rengar—meet me in the hunt!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Youthinkyou understand the jungle, shaman; but you will always be an outsider.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I may seem like you, Vastaya—but we are not the same.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Oho… Are you lost, little Pakiti?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|How would you prefer to die: by spear, or by claw?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You are lost. Let me show you where you belong!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Leave, now! I will not warn you again.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I have defended my home from worse!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Meow… meow-meow, meow-meow-meow-meow… You got that?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Oh, hahahaha-- Can't laugh with a spear through your neck!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Young defender, rest with pride.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|My spear is thetruedeath!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|You wandered too far, little firebug.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Dogs?Really, Naafiri?
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Neeko… My world feels empty, without you.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Never return, brass-bones.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I believe this is called a… Kebab?
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I claim your bones, for my next spear!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Through heart and spine!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|A skilled hunter, makes a swift kill.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|A cub who thought she was full grown! Adorable.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Justice, Rengar.Blood, for blood.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Once an outsider, always an outsider, shaman.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Ohoho, you are fiercer than you think, Yuumi!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|A meal for the worms.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Pakaa protect our own.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|This will make a good lesson for the Pakiti.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I will eat well tonight!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|They never heed my warnings!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Nothing will be wasted.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Prey hide in the sounds of the wild—listen, then strike.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Thebrass-bonesthink they can conquer the wilderness, butnaturecannot be tamed.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I am never alone. My tribe lives in my heart, and in my spear.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I delight in this silence. The quiet before thehunt.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|A hunter's instincts are inherited. A hunter's skills are honed.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|My mother's title came to me heavy—with Kiilashi blood. With it, I keep my family alive.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Human, beast, Vastaya… These words mean nothing to me.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|My tribe calls itself 'the Pakaa'. Only foreign prey call us 'Kashdaji'.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I pay no attention to the affairs of men—until they make me their enemy.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I do not understand the nature of humans; nothing is gained by pointless slaughter.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The jungle lives in my bones. The Pakaa, in my heart.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|There is no need to climb above the canopy… But I enjoy watching the stars.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I am pack-mother, sister, daughter. I have no need to be anything else!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|For generations, I have seen and survived nature's many seasons.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Famine and drought kill predator and prey alike.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Our future is in our Pakiti.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Life circles on.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Clawless hands need a spear.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I take only what I need.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I will always be my mother's cub…
wavs/audio_0094.wav|My quarry won't escape.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|See… Listen… Focus…
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Instinct guides my steps.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I do not question my two forms.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The jungle never sleeps.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I am always Nidalee.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Prowling on two legs felt strange once.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Trespassers are easy to track.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|This land will be the grave of all who trespass!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Soft of paw, light of foot.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I carve my spears from poachers' bones.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I am the wild's protector.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Protecting my pack is my purpose.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I have led my tribe for generations.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|My family, is my strength.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|No hiding!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|There you are!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Hahahaha,my prey now!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Got you!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Claw deep!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Bone cuts bone!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Yes,bleed!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|That's right,run!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|For the kill!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Back on two feet.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Standing strong!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Meow! …Anyway.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Tool in hand!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|As I am!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|The sky is pack-mother to the world: ever-faithful, and protective.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Guide me, pack-sisters, as I once guided you.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|My tribe will not starve this day—I swear it!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I learned to make tools by watching villagers. Thumbs have their place.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|What new tales will the outsiders spin, of their 'monstrous Kashdaji queen'?
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Meow.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Pakiti to feed, and no time to lose.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Trespassers call me 'Kashdaji queen'. I will teach them myrealname.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|They will soon know who prowls this land.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|My quarry got lucky!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|My prey still lives; butIhave not lost its scent.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I don't needthisto tear out your throat!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I don't like when prey talks back.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Stumble.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|The trap is set!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Now, I wait.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Thumbs: useful!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Patience…
wavs/audio_0141.wav|The wild calls. I answer.
