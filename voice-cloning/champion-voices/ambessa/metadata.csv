wavs/audio_0056.wav|I didn't realize I'd get to sample the local fare so soon!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Quit acting the fool!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I made you who you are, Kiramman. And I can unmake you just as easily.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Might doesn't solve every problem, boy.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Your brother must be ashamed he's related to such… filth.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|War begins with the first drop of blood!

wavs/audio_0077.wav|Neverspeak ill of my family.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|The frail have no business in battle!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Hah. A waste of my energy.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|All is fair in love, and war.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Vision, might, even guille—you lackedallof them.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The choice is simple: yield, or be cut down.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|You should've pledged your loyalty… tome.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Your arrogance was your undoing.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|You've changed, Mel. Perhaps now you won't disappoint me.
