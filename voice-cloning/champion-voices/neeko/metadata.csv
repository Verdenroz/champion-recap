wavs/audio_0007.wav|Who strong Neeko now?
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Too late to play nice.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|No one underestimate Neeko!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Bagaduhng!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Neeko cast magic on you. Shoom! Shoom!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|We are to fight now? Let's go!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Chitali!

wavs/audio_0015.wav|Rey'amash!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|"""Bright means danger!"
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Yachisha!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Battle time! Whoop whoop!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Like a wildcat! Rawr!!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Kehkehta!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Ice bird woman! Woo! Neeko need coat.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Fa hasici! It means I like you. In a good way.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|After fight, can Neeko tell you about Oovi-Kat tribe?
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Hello, nature! Nature here looks funny.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Wow! We do not have that where I come from.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Nidalee! Weird seeing you here. Neeko misses you.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|No, Rengar! Be nice and sweet like Nidalee!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Show me more of the world, Taliyah. Take me with you!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You are Vastaya! Neeko is Oovi-Kat. We are... cousins? Distant cousins!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|May I touch your eyeball? Neeko is gentle.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Zyra has many thorns. Too hard for Neeko to get past.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Hello, enemy!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You are not secretly Neeko, are you?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Can our spirits be friends still...?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Told you to not get close. Why did you not listen?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Neeko will keep your sho'ma alive.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Dee dee dee... Just minding my own business, not being Neeko.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|I am being me and doing... me things. Not suspicious.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Be cool. No one suspects you are Neeko.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I am normal! Everything's normal. Nothing is suspicious.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|It's fun to walk around in different skins. Ahaha!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|I am definitely not Neeko. Nope. Not Neeko.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|If Neeko can be everyone, how can Neeko be sure she's anyone?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|No one suspects Neeko to not be Neeko and to be not Neeko instead.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Neeko must stay unseen... until the last moment.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Where is Neeko? I saw Neeko by the river. Everyone knows Neeko likes rivers!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Is Neeko far? Is Neeko near? No one knows...
wavs/audio_0048.wav|This place tastes like many emotions. Excitement, anger, joy and... salty? Is salty a feeling?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Co-'om se-henna. Oh, it means like, um... 'we smile forever.' Friends! That is the word! Friends!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I want to become everybody! Who says I cannot? I will prove them wrong! Then, I will become them. Last laugh? Neeko!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|No more room for problems please. Only room for more cheesebreads.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Every place is beautiful. Every place is danger. Is danger... beautiful?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|The air is part of me. So are the flowers and the rocks. Neeko is everywhere.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Changing bodies is like changing minds. Easy. Neeko can do it! Everyone else make it difficult.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Words are tricky. Better to speak with colors and emotion!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Sho'ma is like, um... the shape of someone's spirit, who they really are inside.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Why do people say   Neeko needs answers now!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|People say 'The world is Neeko's oyster'. Is oyster a good thing? Taste like grapes?
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Sharing memories, colors, feelings is magic! Magic connects people.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Neeko keeps a tiny bit of everybody's sho'ma. They are precious!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|The spirits are all around me. Warm, like hugs!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Crush with Eyeliner
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Do not be bound to a single body. There are so many more.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|What does Neeko do with power? Make people behave.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|People with no tails! Are they lonely? Yes.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Stand back! Big strong Neeko coming though!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|This is very exciting! Everything is falling down!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Neeko does not want to be here when... the others arrive.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|The Oovi-Kats are gone. Neeko is her own tribe now.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|After fight ends, everyone invited to picnic! Even enemies.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|If Neeko becomes Neeko, what does she look like?
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Neeko is on her fourth tail!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Everyone fears Neeko now! Hahaha!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|"""No, tail! We must be angry now."
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I will learn! I will grow! I will... Neeko!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|If Neeko knows your sho'ma, Neeko knows you.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Beauty shines from inside, where the heart dances.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Neeko strong! Can take on world!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Survival means blending in.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Slow down? No! Fast fast fast!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|What to do now? Find cheesebreads? Ooh! Have picnic!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|How can anybody miss home? Home is all around.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Who stands in Neeko's way? Dummies with small sho'ma, that's who!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Neeko might have a thing for birds. And bird people.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Neeko will not break your sho'ma. I promise.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Nice to be something different for a change!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Now we are bonded. Thank you!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|So beautiful! Like moonlight on fresh snow.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Look out! Neeko so fabulous now!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Beep. Boop. Neeko is metal person. Kwatz.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Ahhh!! Neeko on fire! Just kidding.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Not monster. Outsider looking in, wanting to belong. Like Neeko.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Evelynn is so... extreme! Neeko curious...
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Pretty! For a boy. Too pretty.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Neeko will try you on for size. Oooh! I love it!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Ohh... Wish I could stay like this forever.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Neeko is joyful to become you!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Life as Garen just simple. Just swing sword around. Very bland, yes.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Yuck! Take a bath. Gross.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Neeko loves everything about strong... I-yao-i? Did I say it right?
wavs/audio_0101.wav|The Vastayashai'rei tended your sapling, Green Father.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Jinx is wild! Break everything! Phew! Phew!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I like angry Yordle! STAB STAB! TACOS! SKAAAARL!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Do I smell as bad as I look? Yes.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Looking like boys is, um... takes getting used to.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Male sho'ma feels... strange.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Neeko always wanted to be a mountain!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|So many good memories.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|So many colors at once. Neeko could teach you new colors, maybe?
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Oooh. Spoooky.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Does dragon lady want to eat lunch with Neeko sometime? Maybe?
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Hmm... Neeko not the only one who changes.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|The light in me knows the light in Taric.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|How do three people wear one pants?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Feels same... almost like Neeko but faded.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Neeko feels wrong. Not good. Void is full of never.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I like this very much! Knife-bird woman! KA-KOOO!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Just yordling around. Is that what yordles say?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Ouch! Zyra always too prickly.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|A-eh!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Oba!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Boa!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Get ready!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Get ready!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Get ready!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Bidohm!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Jamak!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Neeko was out, but never down.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Poof! Neeko back in her Neeko skin.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Oovi-Kat vacation over. Back to work!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Ugh. Neeko's sho'ma went everywhere. Huge mess. Had to find it all.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Same luck next try.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Tricky tricky! You got the wrong Neeko!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|So easy to trick.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Goodbye, fake Neeko!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Nice try, but no Neeko.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Not Neeko! Hahahahaha!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Hahaa! You fell for it!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|That worked! I fooled them all!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Neeko is best decision!
