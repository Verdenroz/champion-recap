I must not fall.
Feel the sun's glory.
Theywillbe sundered.
Twilight fades.
I will break their line.
They'll have to get through me.
Don't stare directly at me for too long.
I think I broke a nail.  Good thing it wasn't mine.
Rally to me.
I must not fall.
Stay at the vanguard.
First light approaches.
The sun always rises.
I will protect you.
Next time, try to leave a dent!
The dawn has arrived.
