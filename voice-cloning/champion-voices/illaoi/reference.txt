Life is too short for fear.
I slayed greater serpents as a child.
Here they call you a monster. In Buhru, we would call you dinner.
Now... we begin.
The vortex is all.
Reality is brutal.
Youwillbe tested.
Ha ha ha, you think you can beat me?
We never stop.
A good fight.
To live... is to fight.
This is the first lesson.
You are not in motion.
You stagnated.
They need wisdom. They don't need teeth.
Ha! Let's begin again!
You will be destroyed.
This is a great day.
Blessed is motion.
This will be quick.
I am here to test souls.
I am going to walk all over them.
This fits me better than Gangplank.
My god is motion, but speed is useful.
Who is Randuin? Was she a priestess?
Sterak? It is the fury of themotherI will bring.
The Kraken. The Serpent. The Hydra. A god's appearance is limited only by those observing it.
It is my god that protects me, but these metal clothes are nice.
I like this. I should buy everyone one of these.
Only what moves, only what lives... has value.
Things should be held only when we need them.
It is not what we have, it is what we can throw away.
When I am done with this... it will make a fine offering.
Ha!
Ha!
Haa!
This will be a good day, if you live.
Drive forward. it is destiny that calls you.
I don't want you to fail, I want you to learn.
Seize today, and you've earned tomorrow.
I don't want you to worship. I want you to learn.
Now... do you see the truth?
My god doesn't want you to kneel. It wants you to fight.
Your soul drowns. Fight.
Death is only one outcome.
Each of your lives has served the vortex.
This... is... the test.
Every day is waiting to be taken.
You have been given the tools to know your destiny.
Take back your spirit.
You are drowning. I want you to swim.
Countless lifetimes lead our bodies foward, and drive our spirits towards their true destiny.
You speak of having a soul. It was never yours. None of them were.
Your spirit is held, take it if you can.
Each moment is earned.
This moment is waiting to be seized.
The failure of your lives is written on your soul.
You are the tinest sliver of energy held briefly in shape. Where this energy flows is your destiny.
Each lifetime is a spirit. Each lifetime is a chance. Take it.
Our mother demands your tithe.
All of us are lost, all of us are blind. You must swim towards your destiny.
Fight and die with purpose.
I will break you if that's what it takes.
Change, or you will be pulled down.
Child, you must earn your soul. Prove yourself.
What you desire, you must take.
Fear is good. Use it.
The battle is lost only when you surrender. Fight for your soul.
Live your journey, or die in mine.
We are all free. Seeing the truth only reminds us.
Love, fight, live.
Give up, and your life is nothing.
Altak, kaye-sayu. Altak kaye-sayu. Altak kaye-sayu.
Uwon shayos kaya. Uwon shayos, kaya.
I do not walk alone. I am with my god. It is here.
You cannot hide from god. You cannot hide from the test.
Tua-shak yaoto. Tua-shak, yaoto, homu.
Uratu-shak uracheon-mata, rubura-atatufon.
Chae-yama oka-shai.
Buhru-lalare-shi Nagakabouros-sho, Naga-sho.
Behold.
Nagakabouros surrounds us.
The truth is all around you.
This is the motion. All is Nagakabouros.
You are in motion.
You have been tested. You have done well.
You have learned the first lesson.
You swim well.
Nagakabouros accepts your tithe.
Pray I don't have to teach you again.
Don't make me test you again.
Did you blunder into victory, or did you learn?
Learn well, or you will be tested again.
Exactly. If you want your soul, take it.
Do not tire, do not slow, push onward.
This is the way of Nagakabouros: motion!
Not bad! At least you're moving.
Again. Push onward.
Don't stop!
Yes, you are learning.
Good, this is the lesson.
Ha! Well done.
Your souls wait for you. Take them back if you can.
To challenge, to fight... this pleases Nagakabouros.
Keep going, keep striving. This is our way.
Better.
Finally, now you are in motion.
This is how you learn.
Perhaps you're not hopeless after all.
We know your true name. We do not fear you.
Life is not balance. It is motion!
Foolish spirit, begone!
You suffered... but learned nothing.
Your soul is a fetid, stagnant pool, untouched by the tide!
Foul creature, you would stop time when all things must move!
You wanted to be a god! Instead, you are a useless antique!
You are not free from death! Youaredead.
Abomination! You are without motion.
Your powers are stolen from the flow. You have damned your homeland.
You, I like.
Foolish spirit, begone!
I know you are strong. I wonder if you have stamina.
Finally, a man who won't break.
Northman. There are motions I would like to show you.
You move well. Now, you must only find joy in the motion.
You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good.
Laws, rules, these are falsehoods! Truth is chaos!
Duty, honor, nations? These are stagnant falsehoods!
You are slaves enchained by lies when we were born to chase our desires!
What is truly noble and good would never ask you to serve another!
Your god was forgotten. Mine cannot be ignored.
False prophet! You don't even serve a true god!
I do not challenge you, I bring you the test!
Your people seek a worthy death. Mine, a worthy life.
Your people pretend to be strong. I think they are afraid.
You have learned your lesson, now fight! Kill! Conquer!
Did she not show you the way forward? Go!
You want revenge? Take it!
You paid your tithe to the mother. Now show me what she taught you.
I do not want excuses. The failure was yours.
I broke men's hearts. I broke men's spines. You're the first who's going to get both.
You swim well, Gangplank.
You are in motion, love.
Honor? Duty? Ha! What your heart demands is all that matters.
You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good.
Dune
You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good.
Gangplank will find you.
The tempest is Nagakabouros. You serve, but are blind.
I do not challenge you, I bring you the test!
You, I like.
Trust the motion. All spirits are Nagakabouros'.
No love is impossible, my god demands you follow your desires.
Foolish spirit, begone!
Your faith asks for obedience. It is weak.
You worship the sun. It is my god that drives it through the sky.
Your god offers light without wisdom.
Gangplank was drowning. Your actions reminded him to swim.
It is you who have shown Gangplank his path. For that, I thank you.
Gangplank will find you.
You are in motion, but only as a parasite on a host.
Creature, you move, but are useless.
Ugly thing. You weren't designed by god, you were made by fools.
You are a foul creation, born from ignorance.
What kind of stupid god made you?
You, I like.
You are a cloud of broken souls, you are an abomination.
I am your enemy because you offend my god. Because you cannot change.
Fiend, I bring you true death.
You will challenge me? Ha ha ha ha... even death fears my god.
You will trouble this land no more.
You are not welcome here, creature.
You are a cycle without purpose. I will end you!
They have cheated you of rebirth.
Creature, why would I listen to lies when I can see the truth?
You move only from hunger that consumes itself.
Your fine words don't disguise your foul design.
Gangplank will find you.
Aw, child, you are cute, but I doubt you will be for long.
You, I like.
Change, or feel my god's wrath.
Little one, I don't need empathy. Seek those who do.
Go back to where men are weak, and need your inspiration.
Why would I need a spirit's help? I am guided by Nagakabouros.
Tentakill!
It is my burden to carry an eye of god. It is my privilege to see the truth.
To die is to drown, so I will swim well, till I can swim no more.
We cannot comprehend the design. A raindrop cannot comprehend a river valley.
How could I love only one man? They break too easily.
Wisdom is frequently a kick in the head.
Motion is all.
Men live, men die. Change is good.
They will learn or they will die.
My god is not love. It is a kick in the pants.
I am a teacher. Bilgewater will learn.
I break hearts. I break spines.
They must be tested to grow.
This ends one of two ways: they run, or I break them.
Life is the sweetness of fruit, and the joy of battle!
I value truth, and barbecue.
Many gods ask for worship. They are weak gods.
The waves will drag you down, unless you fight to shore.
Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros, names don't matter! Action does.
All that lives... moves.
Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens.
Life is too short for fear.
It is the storm that is life.
All of us are born storms.
Good? Evil? Why should we care for such things?
There are kind and gentle gods. Mine isn't one of those.
I don't scare, I don't tire, and I don't stop.
We are born knowing what to do. We must only act.
The sea is ripe for battle.
There is joy in food... and fighting.
My god doesn't want peace.
The ocean is calm. It is our desires that stir it.
Many die. Worthy souls find new forms.
We are not one soul. We are many.
It is terrible to be satisfied. The world needs us to chase dreams.
If I hate something, I destroy it. If I want something, I take it.
Even if I die, I die in motion.
Chase what is desired.
My name is Illaoi.
Now!
Move!
Learn!
Kebouros!
Shai!
Naga-sho!
Altak!
Behold!
The truth!
This is motion!
All is Nagakabouros!
All is motion!
You cannot hide!
Buhru-latachi.
Nagakabouros, uki, uki.
Sheeyutu Nagakabouros. Nagakabouros-shee-shok.
Buhru-nurataliata-shok.
Epoi-Buhru, daliet-shee.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Live your life, chase what you desire, what else matters?
A fool and his spirit are easily parted.
Smile, child, or I'll shove your jaw into your brain.
Watch your mouth, or I'll slap the soul out of you.
Fight me, if you have the spirit.
I'm not big on sermonsâ€”broken bones teach better lessons.
