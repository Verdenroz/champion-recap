wavs/audio_0001.wav|You're scared, good to know.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Actions have consequences.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Now, it's personal.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Come on, I dare ya!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|You came a long way to die.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Only good Noxian... is a dead one.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Your colors won't fly here!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Watch your back.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Quickness is strength.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|No more rules.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Time foryouto learn.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Our wills donotalign.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|This must be done.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|This, is necessary.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|No more masters!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Secrets kept die with you, Zed!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Shadows don't scare me.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Quick and deadly!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|You're done.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Oh, you're gonna bleed.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Okay, this? I got.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Try to keep up!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Should've run.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Let's end this.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Can't stop me.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I can do this all day.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I'm right here.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Let's go.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Feel me now?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Better bring it.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|This won't take long.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Let's have some fun.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Don't hold back.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Too fast! Too good!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Yeah!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|See ya!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|You're gonna need those bandages, little guy.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Now you're really playing with fire, little girl.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|The will comes from within, not from the blade.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Ugh, Jhin. What a drama queen.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Jinx... Sketchy tats and certifiable. It's just sad.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|How about I takethislife, Karma?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Katarina! Today you will bleed for Ionia!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Kayn. Why are the hot ones always crazy...?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Time to snuff out the light, Lux!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Yi, another master no one needs.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You prune the tree. I'm gonna pull some weeds.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Big targets are easier to hit.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Bad time to come back to the frontlines, Swain.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Steel beats rock, Taliyah.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Better run, Twitch. Hiding won't cut it.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I'm here to finish what Shen couldn't.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I am so sick of shadows.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Ohoho, Zed... This, I will enjoy.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Let me show youmysecrets, Zed.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|You know, we've never met, but you seem really annoying.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Look, I don't wanna kill you... but I will.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Call it a purse. I dare you.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I was trained to kill since I could walk.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Your window to run away... is closing.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|You think you're gonna walk away?
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Still time for you to do the smart thing: go home.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|You may wanna rethink this little encounter.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Come on, at least try!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Aaaand... scene.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You both die, and both lose.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|What a shame. I liked that little guy!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Ugh, that was gross.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Exitthe dragon.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Twilight falls.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Should've stayed hidden.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Too fast for shadows.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Perfect execution.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|You're dead, I'm alive. See? Balance!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|That's right — payback hits hard.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|You don't get back what I take.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I'm already thinking about my next target.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Well you aren't much of a challenge.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Mark acquired, and eliminated.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Youth and skill, every time.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|They had it coming.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|You look so peaceful!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Heard you were tougher.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Smoked 'em.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Who's next?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Still feeling confident?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Likeyouhad a chance.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Take one life at a time. Fast. Clean.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Time to do what's gotta be done.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|The rules hold you back! Leave 'em for someone who needs 'em.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Let's make this quick.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|We're gonna do this my way: quick, and deadly.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Stay outta my way!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Finally. Let's do this.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Forget balance. This is a reckoning.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|It's not the killing I'm about — it's the cause.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|The Fist of Shadow was my mom — I do things differently.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The only rule that matters, is that your enemies don't walk away.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I got a pack full of trouble, and nothing but time.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|So many enemies, so many knives.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|If you look dangerous, you betterbedangerous.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Everyone's got a weakness.That'smy target.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|The Kinkou couldn't control me. I do what they wouldn't.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|There are over three hundred pressure points on the human body. No one can protect 'em all.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I'll make this look like magic.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I make problems... disappear.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I am my own master. Just the way I like it.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The words on their tombstones will be my new mantras.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|No one tells me what to do. Not anymore.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|It's not about the killing. It's about who's doing the dying.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Magic's fine — steel's better.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Restraint's not... really my thing.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|If they're smart, they're scared.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Let 'em see me, they can't stop me.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I love what I do. My enemies won't.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Wars are messy. My kills are clean.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Gonna carve my own path.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The old ways just don't work.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|How about I just end this.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|No more meditation or masters!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Skill and steel will get the job done.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|They can't stop me. I mean, they can try.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Kama, or kunai... Depends how I'm feelin'.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I'm not here to make friends.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Can't stop what's comin'.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|You can never have too many kunai.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Cold steel and a target are all I need.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I work alone, it's better for everyone.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|You willnotstop me!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Okay, that one was messy.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Don't waste the anger, channel it.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Lesson learned.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Okay...
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I was just warming up.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|That is just another reason for you to die.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I can make this fast, or really fast. Choice is yours.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Oh, look. Someone's got a death wish.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Fear the assassin with no master.
