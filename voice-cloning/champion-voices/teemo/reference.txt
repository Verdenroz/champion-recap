Aquatic yordle sighting: throws fish?! Details to follow.
Whoa, what kind of yordle areyou?
Hey, Kennen, if I train you in the scout code, can you train me at the ways of the Kinkou?

Hey Vex, let's turn that frown uuupside down!

Like the Bandle scout handbook says: 'Leave the forest cleaner than you found it.'
Even heroes gotta take a break; huh, Poppy?
Did anyone else hear that? No...? Okay!
Sounds like someone found one of my mushrooms!
Whoopsie-daisy.
Oops. Did I do that?
Was that too much?
Whoa, you've got an eject button! Is that a new feature, Rumble?
Please don't be mad, Tristana... I-it wasn't personal! Scout's honor!!
No more shooting, Mr. Turret!
Eh, I'll clean that up later.
Muuuuch better!
Maybe you'll be less evil after a nap, Veigar.
You would be a perfect Bandle scout, Vex!
Yeah... I had to let Fluffy go, too...
See you back inBandle City!

Gotta go consult the handbook...
Sometimes, it's good to retrace your steps!
