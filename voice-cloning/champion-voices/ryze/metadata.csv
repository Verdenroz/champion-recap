wavs/audio_0001.wav|Fine.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Fine.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|A fine edge you dance on.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Stay back.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Makers guide me!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Time dwindles.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|By will.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|They come for the scroll.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Leave now.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|This ends badly.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|They have no idea.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Last chance.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Let's have it, then.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Blood will spill.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|You know nothing of loss.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Away.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I am just a vessel.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Are you following me?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|If you insist.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|This might burn.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I read the runes. You lose.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Ah, the hard way.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|I don't have time for this!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Hands off the runes.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|You've got nothing.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You won't win this.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Many lives it's taken, and many souls.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Strange how it beckons.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|An object of foul origins.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Now I'll never tire.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Sweet rune juice.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Fuel for the rune race.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Such a vile text, but useful.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|A sordid relic from a brutal time.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Not a book for the faint of heart.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|In case my head gets cold.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|To cover my bald spot.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|A hat with a face, huh? Sure, why not?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|A potent haberdashery.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Brings out my colour.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Fundamental.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|It's a start.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Even the gods can weep.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I remember when such tears were shed.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Now we're talking.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Such a weapon must be treated with respect.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I'd destroy it... if I didn't need it.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|I can feel its power surging.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Their weapons will fail to scratch.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Protection from primitive arms.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I defy swords and arrows.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Great, more things to carry.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Provisions purchased.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|This better work.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|That's gonna load me down.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|They will not... take them...
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Hide... them...
wavs/audio_0058.wav|The scroll... burn it...
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Target!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Mark!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|There!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Ah!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Fix!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Your charms are impressive, but I'm not into forest creatures.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Run along, child, this tome is not a bedtime story.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Space called, it wants its arrogant jerk back.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I don't suppose you'd want to get off your magical rear and help me save this world.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I have a hard time believing you went to medical school.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I would chide you for your idiocy, but you seem pretty proud of it.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Nice tattoos, do they conduct runic energy? No? Oh, that's too bad.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Magic is more than sunshine and rainbows, girl.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Hey, you're the one who summons bloodthirsty Void creatures, right? Yeah, brilliant work, good thinking.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|You wage your petty war, Noxian, but the real war is yet to come.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Nice card trick, do you do birthday parties?
wavs/audio_0076.wav|That remarkable arcane energy doesn't run through your entire body, does it?
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Even your kind will know death in the cataclysm.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Okay, fine, here's a magic trick. Tada.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|What? You want to see a magic trick? Fine... tada.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I tried to warn them. I really did.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Better a few perish than the entire world.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|They make the same mistakes again and again.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|That's what happens when you piss off an archmage!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Too many have met the same fate.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|What is made can be unmade.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Another barrier down.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Reduced to rubble.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|One less thing to kill me.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Let's move, the path is clear.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|One less impediment.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|One more needless death.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Won't be the last.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|They never learn.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Another dead fool.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Better you than me.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Another joins the energy pool.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|To the next one.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Always learning, always seeking.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Those who seek improvement, improve.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|This power continues to build.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|The things I've seen in the dark corners of Runeterra are better left unseen.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|If I sound rude, it's because I've got a world to save.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|"""I find the runes so they won't be found by someone else... or some"
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Things to do today: find food, build shelter, fix the world.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Can we make this quick? I have some place to be!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I sense another rune, but where?
wavs/audio_0107.wav|You know what I miss? Standing still.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|They know so little of the world they traverse.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Knowledge is a real weapon.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|They want to read my scroll. It'll be the last thing they read.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|All that binds this world is will.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Roast duck, warm fire... someday.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I fight so they don't have to.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|You know what I could use? An ale.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Just once I'd like a good night's sleep.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|The wise seek to contain power.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Power changes everyone.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|What's on my back? That's not your concern.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Consider yourself lucky for the days you have.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Everyone is doomed to repeat history. That's where I come in.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Every rune I find is another day we live.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Everyone wants to chat when you're busy saving the world.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|The runes decide my path.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I've heard entire nations go silent.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Fast and lean, that's how I travel.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I long for the day when this is all over.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I dream in nightmares of the past.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Blessing or curse, what's the difference?
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I remember when only one world weighed on my shoulders.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Some stones are best left unturned.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Take care with this world.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|If I had a rune for every mile I've run, I'd be done running.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I like my tragedy narrowly averted.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Do not walk through history. Run.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|You want to help? Get out of the way.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|If I fall, the scroll must be destroyed.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Ah, civilization. I remember when I was a part of it.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Their minds couldn't handle what my eyes have seen.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|In an instant, all could be gone.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I care about these mortals. That's why I keep them at arm's length.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I work alone. Company weighs me down.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Trust no one, especially those who seek power.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Ah, Runeterrans. So endearing, so foolish.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Quickly but carefully.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Magic dooms us... but perhaps it can save us.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Terrible things are afoot.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|I may fail, but I won't quit.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|My story? That would take ages to tell.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|One can only hold all this power for so long.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I could tell you what's on this scroll, but then I'd have to obliterate you.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|None are worthy of my task... even me.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|They have forgotten the fires that forged this world.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|All this would be so much easier if I didn't give a damn.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|When I've found them all, I'll fade away.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|These runes are not for eyes such as yours.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|No time to talk.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|There it is.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Like dominoes!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Expand!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Push.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Release.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Out.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Back.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Right.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Compounded!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Come. The runes beckon.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|A rune mage must keep moving.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Flee if you want to live.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Let's go, let's go!
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Our fight is elsewhere.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Time to reflect on what we have learned.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I'll return stronger. Count on it.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Hang on, archmage business.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|A moment to gather our runes.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|I'm not running away. I'm running at you the long way around.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|A pause in the chaos. Let's make it count.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Thank the gods, the world's still here.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Ugh, being dead wastes precious time!
wavs/audio_0179.wav|I still live, but for how much longer?
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Let's try again, and this time do it right.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|A stupid mistake, one I won't make again.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|I thought that guy would never stop talking.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|You should read more, expand your vocabulary.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|So that's what you people do with your spare time.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|I'm surprised you can string enough words together for that one. You need a break?
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Not going to dignify that with a response.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|We'll see how smart your mouth is when the world collapses.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|If I had a tattoo that looked like you, I'd get it removed.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Hm. I'm hunted by things far worse than you.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|There's gonna be two sounds: me hitting you, and you disintegrating.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|To be ignorant is to be free. You must be very free.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|I'm no doctor, but I think there's a spell for what you have.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Sight is better than swords.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Dark corners made bright.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|They come for what I know.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Watching the watchers.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Dark shadows hide dark forces.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|I'd like to see them try.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|For whatever lurks behind me.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|I never liked surprises.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|If I can see it, I can beat it.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Sight makes might.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Cease!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Hold!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Be still!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Root!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Steadfast!
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Trap!
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Catch!
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Locked up tight!
wavs/audio_0212.wav|A step ahead of cataclysm.
