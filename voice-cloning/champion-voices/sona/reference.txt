Dissonance.
Someone's feeling it.
Right on queue.
Two hearts in three-four time.
Don't make me get off stage.
I'll help you find your seat.
If you insist.
A sublime duet.
Wrong key!
We've got a heckler.
An aggressive movement!
Your pitch is off.
I'm not looking for notes.
The fanfare ascends.
Quiet, please!
Delicately.
Harmoniously.
A symphony of justice.
Back off.
Keep your voice down!
With perfect tempo.
You've struck a bad chord.
Here's your show.
Order through music.
Double time!
Triple time!
Step lively.
Hold that note.
Pick up the pace!
Accelerated movement.
Fiddlesticks? But the songs, they can't be real.
Is that Irelia? I haven't seen her since the restoration.
Why won't Jarvan act? All it would take is a single decree.
Am I supposed to know this person? Is he a... fan?
A Crownguardanda mage? Wouldn't want to be her.
And where has Ryze been? Hunting for more world ending relics?
Oh. Is the grand general a fan?
Sylas? He hasn't changed. And my answer is still no.
It's good to see Taric hasn't changed. And bad. It's both.
There's so much pain in Xin Zhao's heart. Why?
Just keep smiling and... Maybe they'll go away.
When fields lie calm, and wind stands still. Run home.
Sorry Garen, but I can't help if I'm locked up.
I don't think Ionia will be rushing to invite me back.
A single decree and he just wouldn't do it.
Did he want four autographs? I don't understand.
Don't worry Lux. One day, our kind will be free.
Those artifacts can't really end the world Ryze, right?
Good. Mages have enough problems without you Sylas.
Get up Taric. You're chewing the scenery.
We're both a long way from home Xin Zhao. Rest easy.
Ugh. That wasn't part of the show.
Oh, they'll be fine.
Just an intermission I hope.
Ugh, hecklers.
Everyone's a critic.
I never could refuse an empty stage. Not even this one.
Haha. I can never shake the nerves before a big performance.
Curtains up. I'm ready.
Mastery is the first step. The rest is what you do with it.
My music warms old souls and soothes hardened hearts. It is my greatest joy.
Demacia is my home, but I will never forget Ionia.
Strings move, and people dance in time with the memories.
Art bridges the gaps between people. Governments, not so much.
Magic is like a song. It's woven into everything. Waiting.
This is no ordinary instrument. More like an old friend.
The world is cruel. Until that changes, I'll never stop playing.
A wrong note is just...a happy little accident.
Hear and feel everything
My music is my voice.
Stir the music of the heart.
I'll play any stage once. Some, just the once.
A melody to guide us home.
King or commoner, everyone loves a show.
The right song can soothe the soul of a nation.
Never be afraid to listen.
The rhythm connects us all.
Practice makes perfect.
A true masterpiece should celebrate living.
I find inspiration in every smile and every tear.
The joy of an audience is always worth it.
Life is a beautiful ballad.
Hmm, which arrangement suits the mood?
Emotion, love, those are the real instruments!
The symphony never ends.
Art is something everyone can share.
The tempo changes and so do we.
Again!
Open it up!
Dynamic.
Feel it!
Sempre.
Fortissimo.
Requiem.
Elegy!
Finale!
Symphony!
Once more with feeling.
Oops. Lost myself for a minute.
A surprise encore? If they insist.
Huh. Sounds like a personal problem.
Just setting up before the next song.
It's like a little usher.
You look out for me and I'll look out for you.
Remember to wait for your cue.
Keep and eye out for music snobs.
Every note is important.
Accurate like a metronome.
A duet.
In unison.
You're doing fine.
I've got you.
Play on.
Everything in harmony.
Encore, encore!
What masterpiece shall we play today?
