Akshan_Ban.wav|akshan|en|I'm going to remember this.
Akshan_Original_Attack_0.wav|akshan|en|You know why I'm here.
Akshan_Original_Attack_1.wav|akshan|en|You're in deep, friend.
Akshan_Original_Attack_10.wav|akshan|en|Vengeance with a smile.
Akshan_Original_Attack_11.wav|akshan|en|Oh come now.
Akshan_Original_Attack_12.wav|akshan|en|Say your goodbyes.
Akshan_Original_Attack_13.wav|akshan|en|Defend yourself!
Akshan_Original_Attack_14.wav|akshan|en|Eyes on the cape.
Akshan_Original_Attack_15.wav|akshan|en|You don't deserve life.
Akshan_Original_Attack_16.wav|akshan|en|I'm afraid you must pay.
Akshan_Original_Attack_17.wav|akshan|en|Too late to atone.
Akshan_Original_Attack_18.wav|akshan|en|This is when I shoot you.
Akshan_Original_Attack_19.wav|akshan|en|You earned this.
Akshan_Original_Attack_2.wav|akshan|en|Take your comeuppance.
Akshan_Original_Attack_3.wav|akshan|en|I don't envy you.
Akshan_Original_Attack_4.wav|akshan|en|Have you no shame?
Akshan_Original_Attack_5.wav|akshan|en|Confess!
Akshan_Original_Attack_6.wav|akshan|en|Scoundrel!
Akshan_Original_Attack_7.wav|akshan|en|Any last words?
Akshan_Original_Attack_8.wav|akshan|en|You've been naughty.
Akshan_Original_Attack_9.wav|akshan|en|Tsk, tsk.
Akshan_Original_Death_0.wav|akshan|en|Absolve... me.
Akshan_Original_Death_2.wav|akshan|en|That hurts...
Akshan_Original_Death_3.wav|akshan|en|Oh... I see...
Akshan_Original_E_0.wav|akshan|en|Coming through!
Akshan_Original_E_1.wav|akshan|en|Akshan, away!
Akshan_Original_E_2.wav|akshan|en|Whoosh!
Akshan_Original_E_3.wav|akshan|en|Watch your head!
Akshan_Original_E_4.wav|akshan|en|It's as fun as it looks.
Akshan_Original_E_5.wav|akshan|en|Heads up!
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterCamille.wav|akshan|en|Hey! Grappling hook buddies! No? Okay, suit yourself.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterEzreal.wav|akshan|en|I know you! You're that kid who stole the gauntlet.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterLucian.wav|akshan|en|Well if it isn't sentinel serious. Look at all the rules I'm breaking.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterSentinel.wav|akshan|en|Greetings, fellow sentinel! How strange that we are not friends today. Oh, well.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterShadowIsles.wav|akshan|en|You work with Viego, yes? Scoundrel by association!
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterSivir.wav|akshan|en|You're from Shurima? And have a boomerang? We should hang out!
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounterViego.wav|akshan|en|Silly Viego, we can't bring back those we've lost. I mean, I can but... not you.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|akshan|en|Sorry, can't let you live. You understand.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|akshan|en|Well. You look very guilty of something.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounter_2.wav|akshan|en|I've got something for you. It's... comeuppance.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounter_3.wav|akshan|en|I know what you're feeling. It's regret.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounter_4.wav|akshan|en|It's not too late to turn around you know.
Akshan_Original_FirstEncounter_5.wav|akshan|en|I don't know how you live with yourself, but you won't have to for long.
Akshan_Original_Joke.wav|akshan|en|Up, up and... maybe not.
Akshan_Original_JokeResponse.wav|akshan|en|That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life.
Akshan_Original_KillPenta.wav|akshan|en|Hahaha! They never expect the grappling hook!
Akshan_Original_Kill_0.wav|akshan|en|Consider yourself... absolved.
Akshan_Original_Kill_1.wav|akshan|en|Now think about what you did.
Akshan_Original_Kill_2.wav|akshan|en|Always hard taking a life. But I get over it.
Akshan_Original_Kill_3.wav|akshan|en|That was quite satisfying.
Akshan_Original_Kill_4.wav|akshan|en|Yeah. I'd say we're even.
Akshan_Original_Kill_5.wav|akshan|en|You know you had that coming, right?
Akshan_Original_Kill_6.wav|akshan|en|There, now everyone's happy. Except you.
Akshan_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|akshan|en|Shadya would approve of this. I think. You never could tell with her.
Akshan_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|akshan|en|So... this is what it's like to have friends.
Akshan_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|akshan|en|This cape is not up to Sentinel Code. But, neither is the grappling hook, nor the boomerang.
Akshan_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|akshan|en|We are not helpless. We are the ones who shape our destinies. Now, let's go shoot these villains in the face.
Akshan_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|akshan|en|There is no such thing as fate. But there is such a thing as Akshan.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_0.wav|akshan|en|It's important to stride into the wind so the cape flutters dramatically behind.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_1.wav|akshan|en|Vengeance is not a healthy impulse. Here's to bad health!
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_2.wav|akshan|en|Some people say I hold a grudge too long but... those people are dead.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_3.wav|akshan|en|What else can I add to this gun? Maybe a shovel. No-a ladder!
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_4.wav|akshan|en|How does this boomerang return? Someday I'm going to learn its secrets.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_5.wav|akshan|en|'Don't use the absolver', they said. 'No one must wield such a weapon'. Eh, I disagree.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_OFF_6.wav|akshan|en|Not everything happens for a reason. Some things need to be sorted out.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_0.wav|akshan|en|You try to rest and some lowlife kills one of your pals. Such is life.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_1.wav|akshan|en|They take one of mine. I take one of theirs.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_2.wav|akshan|en|Here we go. Get in. Avenge fallen ally. Get out.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_3.wav|akshan|en|A friend has gone silent. Let's wake them up shall we?
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_4.wav|akshan|en|The bad part about having friends? Always having to avenge them.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_5.wav|akshan|en|I can feel them shaking in their armor. I love this part.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_6.wav|akshan|en|Listen to them. 'Oh no, is Akshan coming to kill me?' Hahahahaha. I am!
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_7.wav|akshan|en|Shadya would not approve of this act of vengeance but... she wouldn't approve of a lot of things.
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_8.wav|akshan|en|I hear the dead crying out for vengeance. I am coming, friend!
Akshan_Original_MoveLong_WPassive_ON_9.wav|akshan|en|Killing this person won't bring my friend back. Actually, it will! Let's go do that.
Akshan_Original_Move_0.wav|akshan|en|He who takes a life bears its mark on his soul.
Akshan_Original_Move_1.wav|akshan|en|Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later.
Akshan_Original_Move_10.wav|akshan|en|Some people just don't want to pay with their lives.
Akshan_Original_Move_11.wav|akshan|en|A villain will show you much when they don't know you are watching.
Akshan_Original_Move_12.wav|akshan|en|I once knew someone who followed the rules. She's dead.
Akshan_Original_Move_13.wav|akshan|en|I do not break rules. I bend them. Ever so slightly.
Akshan_Original_Move_14.wav|akshan|en|Just desserts coming right up.
Akshan_Original_Move_15.wav|akshan|en|Curse this nagging conscience of mine.
Akshan_Original_Move_16.wav|akshan|en|A scoundrel left alone will always be a scoundrel.
Akshan_Original_Move_17.wav|akshan|en|People without grappling hooks, what are they thinking?
Akshan_Original_Move_18.wav|akshan|en|Once they see me, it is too late for forgiveness.
Akshan_Original_Move_19.wav|akshan|en|Who am I to decide who lives and dies? Huh. Just a guy.
Akshan_Original_Move_2.wav|akshan|en|Mmm, yes. Villainy is near.
Akshan_Original_Move_20.wav|akshan|en|Death? I laugh at death! Ha! Listen to me laugh!
Akshan_Original_Move_21.wav|akshan|en|Okay, villains. Time to soil yourselves.
Akshan_Original_Move_22.wav|akshan|en|Talk is worthless. We are what we do.
Akshan_Original_Move_23.wav|akshan|en|I've got quite a few tricks up my cape.
Akshan_Original_Move_24.wav|akshan|en|I live by my own code. Don't be an ass.
Akshan_Original_Move_25.wav|akshan|en|How well I know the silence of a lonely life.
Akshan_Original_Move_26.wav|akshan|en|Huh, nice place. Lotta things to swing from.
Akshan_Original_Move_3.wav|akshan|en|Can't talk. Sentinel business. Super important.
Akshan_Original_Move_4.wav|akshan|en|Ha ha! The thrill of going where you're not supposed to.
Akshan_Original_Move_5.wav|akshan|en|Some people deserve a low blow.
Akshan_Original_Move_6.wav|akshan|en|I hate shooting them in the back. I don't get to see their surprise.
Akshan_Original_Move_7.wav|akshan|en|Sometimes fate just needs a little nudge.
Akshan_Original_Move_8.wav|akshan|en|Things to do. Scores to settle.
Akshan_Original_Move_9.wav|akshan|en|The world won't save itself. You know.
Akshan_Original_Q_0.wav|akshan|en|Look at it go!
Akshan_Original_Q_1.wav|akshan|en|Ha! Boomerang!
Akshan_Original_Q_2.wav|akshan|en|All in the wrist.
Akshan_Original_Q_3.wav|akshan|en|Ha!
Akshan_Original_Q_4.wav|akshan|en|Watch it fly!
Akshan_Original_R_0.wav|akshan|en|You're going to love this!
Akshan_Original_R_1.wav|akshan|en|Here comes the 'uppance!
Akshan_Original_R_2.wav|akshan|en|Oh, the anticipation!
Akshan_Original_R_3.wav|akshan|en|Oh, so exciting!
Akshan_Original_Recall_0.wav|akshan|en|Like the mysterious boomerang, I always return.
Akshan_Original_Recall_1.wav|akshan|en|I come and go at unpredictable times. That is Akshan's thing!
Akshan_Original_Recall_2.wav|akshan|en|Now for my grand escape. Grappling hook!
Akshan_Original_Recall_3.wav|akshan|en|Right, then. Up we go!
Akshan_Original_Recall_4.wav|akshan|en|Only one way out of this mess. Skyward!
Akshan_Original_Respawn_0.wav|akshan|en|Shadya's frowning at me now. I should've paid more attention to her lessons.
Akshan_Original_Respawn_1.wav|akshan|en|Someone gave me comeuppance? Ha! Who do they think they are?
Akshan_Original_Respawn_2.wav|akshan|en|Yes, yes. The guy who revives people died... I'm really going to hear about this one...
Akshan_Original_Respawn_3.wav|akshan|en|So... back at square one again. Let us proceed to a better square.
Akshan_Original_Respawn_4.wav|akshan|en|Well. This is embarrassing.
Akshan_Original_Respawn_5.wav|akshan|en|No shame in starting over! So I tell myself, anyway.
Akshan_Original_Taunt.wav|akshan|en|I taunt with my grappling hook. See how it taunts you? Taunt, taunt, taunt...
Akshan_Original_WEnd_0.wav|akshan|en|I'm back! Take note, evil!
Akshan_Original_WEnd_1.wav|akshan|en|Gotcha!
Akshan_Original_WEnd_2.wav|akshan|en|You're an easy one to find.
Akshan_Original_WEnd_3.wav|akshan|en|Knock, knock. Vengeance calling.
Akshan_Original_WEnd_4.wav|akshan|en|Ha! I have you now.
Akshan_Original_WEnd_5.wav|akshan|en|Miss me?
Akshan_Original_WEnd_6.wav|akshan|en|Hey! I snuck in.
Akshan_Original_WEnd_7.wav|akshan|en|That's right. It is I.
Akshan_Original_WEnd_8.wav|akshan|en|So... how's it going?
Akshan_Original_WEnd_9.wav|akshan|en|Ha! I have sneaked upon you!
Akshan_Original_W_0.wav|akshan|en|Ha ha! Their eyes cannot find me.
Akshan_Original_W_1.wav|akshan|en|Stealth tiiime! I mean... Stealth time...
Akshan_Original_W_2.wav|akshan|en|To the shadows... where the scoundrels hide.
Akshan_Original_W_3.wav|akshan|en|Ohohoho, I love sneaking.
Akshan_Original_W_4.wav|akshan|en|Sometimes, I even sneak up on myself!
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_0.wav|akshan|en|Yes, yes. You can thank me later.
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_2.wav|akshan|en|Have a good rest?
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_3.wav|akshan|en|Dear friends, please stop dying. -Love, Akshan.
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_4.wav|akshan|en|Reclaimed by the light! Yadda-yadda-yadda...
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_5.wav|akshan|en|There you are. Welcome back.
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_6.wav|akshan|en|It was nothing. Really.
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_7.wav|akshan|en|You are reclaimed. Go! Live!
Akshan_Original_W_PassiveAlly_8.wav|akshan|en|Let's try not to do that again, hm?
Akshan_Select.wav|akshan|en|Fixing the world, one scoundrel at a time!
