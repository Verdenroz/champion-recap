wavs/audio_0001.wav|Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Whoa! You're a big fella!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|This should really be the hero's job.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Wow. That's a lot to hammer.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I really don't have anything against dragons.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Nothing personal, but... I need to squash you.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|This guy seems nice. I feel bad about killing him.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Sorry, your majesty.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|You should probably take cover.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Swinging from the heels!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Here goes everything.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|You might wanna look out.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|One whomp at a time.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Y-You're in my way!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Sorry about this.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Better get your guard up.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Careful, this packs a wallop.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I can do this.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|No backing down.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Guess we're fighting.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Ready, hammer?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I hope this works.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|You are... definitely not the hero.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Keep swinging till you hit something.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|One shield for throwing, and one for holding.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|A hammer for my hammer.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I'll just add it to my other hammer.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Well, two hammers are better than one.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Hmm... nice weapon. Does it come in hammer?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|You smash people with it, right?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|It's a little big, but I'll grow into it.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Yeah. Just like the hero would buy.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Got me some hammer accessories.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Goes great with a hammer.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Yay, more stuff!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Right in my hammer...
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Don't move!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Freeze!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You. Sit!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Hold it right there!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Look out!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Move it!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Back off!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Outta' my way!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|You sure you wanna do this? You don't even have a weapon.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Look at all that shiny armor. Sorry I gotta mess it up.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I'm about to hammer you in the jewels.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|I don't get Yordles. Too fluffy.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|A Demacian, a Noxian and a Freljordian walk into a tavern.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|And the Piltie says, 'Can I own this ba--- uh, I own this bank, so...' He doesn't want anything because heownsthe bank...
wavs/audio_0051.wav|The barkeep asks, 'What'll it be?'
wavs/audio_0052.wav|The Demacian says, 'Uh, I'll have a wine.' No, wait, an ale! Yeah...
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Then the Noxian says, 'I'll have a... a wine.' Yeah, he wants a wine.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|And the Freljordian says, 'I'll drink anything, so long as--- ' Wait, hold on, let me start over.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|A Noxian, a Targonian and a Piltie are robbing a bank.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|The bank guy says, 'I'll give you whatever you want.'
wavs/audio_0057.wav|The Noxian says, 'I'll take whatever gold you got back there.'
wavs/audio_0058.wav|The Targonian says, 'Gimme' all your gemstones!'
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I got lucky—you'll get me next time.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I'm running out of heroes.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I wish they'd give up trying to stop me, but I can understand their position.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|They try to knock me down, but I have a low center of gravity.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Aaannd, my search continues.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Well, that wasn't the hero.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Oh, wow, Garen, do you think you could sign my shield?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Garen, I think you might be the one!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|A pleasure to fight for you, your majesty.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|The hammer isn't mine, just keeping it until the real guy shows up.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I've heard a lot about this hero with a hammer, can't wait to meet him.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Not coming back 'til I find that hero.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|One time I thought I found the hero... but he died.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Today's the day I find that hero.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Hmm... if I were a hero, where would I hide...?
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Who knew there were so many heroes?
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Sometimes you just gotta do it yourself.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Me? The hero? Nah, that's ridiculous.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Yep, it's even heavier than it looks.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|If you're waiting for me to give up, you might be here a while.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Okay, I admit it. I'm lost.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Know what I could use? A cart.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The hammer does most of the work, I just swing it.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Every step is one step closer.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I sure do a lot of walking.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I hope the hero likes me.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I'm in, one-hundred-percent! That's everything, right?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Some things are too important to give up on.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Just had a thought—three pigtails!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Man, quests are hard.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I could really go for a nap.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Guess I'm going this way now.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Oh, you like to fight? So does my hammer!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|What do you mean my hammer's too big?
wavs/audio_0094.wav|How Demacian of you!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Donotmake my hammer mad.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|I gotta see this through.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Got it.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Shieldy...
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Hope it's not dented.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Left hand!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Shield to the face!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Clang!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Comin' down!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Hammer!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|And stay there!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|And don't come back!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Remember to roll!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Look at him go!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Huh. Didn't know I could do that.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Whoa. You went far.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Up goes the guy!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Whomp!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Wait, what did I come back for?
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Anyone seen a hero around here?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Now, back to finding that hero.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|That's okay. I'm playing the long game.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|One thing about me: I'm not good at staying down.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Let's try that again.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|This hammer has two sides. Did you want to feel the other one too?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Could you maybe get out of the way? Y'know, so I don't have to flatten you.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, uh... hammer!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|To the hero!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Fuel for the quest.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Alright, sneakies... I know you're out there.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|...Just in case they come creeping.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Hold on...
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Not like this!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Keep fighting...
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Not today!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|No getting through me.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Hold up!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Nope.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Uh uh.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|What's the hurry?
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I'm no hero—just a Yordle with a hammer.
