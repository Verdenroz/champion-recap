We won't be muzzled.
You arenotthe apex.
Limb from limb!
Mangle it.
Fight or flight, morsel!
Does it bleed?
Just a nip!
Lesser creature!
As one!
Rend its flesh!
Hackles raised!
Wedaredyou to run!
There's our prey!
It fears us!
Now, we charge!
Push them out!
Run, rabbit.
Are you hurt, little bird?
We taste it!
Teeth in their throats!
Sweet marrow!
Tail... between... legs...
We smell... nothing...
Our hunger... fades.
The chase... ends...
The chase... ends...
Our hunger... fades.
We smell... nothing...
Tail... between... legs...
Stubborn Aatrox, so driven to die.
Focus your rage, Aatrox. The pack needs you!
How fast can you run, cat?
Rhaast, is that you? Love the new vessel!
Still struggling with your vessel, Rhaast? How unfortunate.
Targonians...
My, my—aren'tyoufull of delicious bones?
It smells of the desert winds... It is Shuriman.
You always were the reasonable one, Varus; so back away.
Do not pity us Varus—we are now greater.
Wretched yordle. What's the point of chasing something that doesn't try?!
Still some meat on those metal bones...
A wolf with no pack? No wonder you howl!
Yordle!
We should thank you, Myisha. You showed us the way.
Find a hole, vermin... and hide yourself away.
So, the trail of stench ends here. Hello, prey...
It does not bark. It is not brethren...
You're a long way from the den, pup...!
Shake it ragged, snap its neck!
Don't expect us to roll over and beg.
Hear the gnashing of innumerable teeth!
What creature isfoolenough to hunt in our domain?
We can hear your heart racing, little bird...
Who's a good dog? ...We are.
I'm sorry; did you wish to smell my backside?
I'm sorry; did you wish to smell my backside?
Who's a good dog? ...We are.
At long last—enough bones for us all!
At long last—enough bones for us all!
Bury it for later.
Pick it clean.
Wallow in their remains.
Tastes like terror...
Kill its offspring, so we may thrive!
Death from a thousand bites!
No! Savour it...
Each gets a turn at the carcass!
Ugh, all gristle.

TheDarkinrise. Five sets of teeth in a ravenous maw.
Calloused by the burning sands ofShurima. What can harm us, in this place?
One mind, spread among many vessels; this, is the way of the pack.
What chance will the world have, when the Darkin hunt as one?
It's not the strongest who survive—it's the most united.
Let the world hear our howls and know that death awaits.
Why beg for scraps? Our meal is the entire feast!
I could've led them. I could've dominated. But, there is noI... onlywe.
Our kind had such a proving ground, once. All it proved was avarice.
We never release our bite, even if the blood chokes us.
Shurima gave me knowledge, the pack gave me wisdom.
Ego is an illusion. A survival trick, for a feeble mind.
We track for a thousand years. None can flee for that long.
The tragedy of the kill is that it ends our chase.
A dune hound leaves nothing. Not even the bones!
The jaws of victory have many teeth!
The lone dog eats small game.
Coordination, not chaos.
It's lonely at the top of the food chain!
Prey is near... Approach with tact.
Even the strongest can be overwhelmed.
Find their burrows! Ravage their warrens.
We do not cower from a raised hand.
Humans are petty—tear at their pride.
The world is full of such savory little birds...
What game skitters by, unaware of death?
Unbroken, and unleashed!
One learns to step quickly across hot sand.
Humans use more words, but say less.
Together, we ascend once more.
We've picked up a scent!
Nothing tastes better than the heels of fleeing prey!
One covers less ground on two legs.
When the moment is right...
Ahhh, the stench of panic!
Sunborn, but pack raised.
The faster they run, the sweeter the meat.
Even Darkin need to eat.
Let us expand our feeding grounds.
Let's get some blood on our muzzles.
The best defense is to bite first.
There is no alpha, there is only the pack.
The pack increases!
Welcome, fellow hound.
We are more!
Go forth, vessel.
Our number grows!
Knives abound.
More mouths, more bite.
The pack increases!
Welcome, fellow hound.
We are more!
Go forth, vessel.
Our number grows!
Knives abound.
More mouths, more bite.
Smells like conflict. We must prepare!
This is not slinking away, this is regrouping!
Let us rest elsewhere—never where we feed.
This is not the feeding hour. Not just yet...
Back to the den!
The knives pull us homeward; the pack abides.
A good hound never forgets the way home.
Our tail wags.
The pack is grateful.
Ahh yes, right behind the ears!
Our tail wags.
The pack is grateful.
Ahh yes, right behind the ears!
They think us beaten... But we've got their scent now.
That was just... playing dead.
Our pack has thinned, but what remains is stronger!
No time to lick wounds—we must bite the hand that struck us!
They take us for a lapdog. Let us show them our teeth!
We stagger on, parched as the desert dunes.
Famished. A meal would set us right...
That which cannot die, will in time devour all.

We hope you allow dogs... for your sake.
Little something to... Whet our teeth!
Move slowly, shopkeep. Wouldn't want to alarm us.
Something to chew on, perhaps?
Do not fear, shopkeep... We only kill things that flee!
Do not confuse feral, with stupid.
Small things try to look big, don't they?

Meat!
