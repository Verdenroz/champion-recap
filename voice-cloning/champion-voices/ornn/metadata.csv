wavs/audio_0001.wav|Back to the forge.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I don't like the look of that thing.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|We never talk. Might as well fight!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Your sword has no counterbalance!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Give me the ale and no one gets hurt.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Stop building!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|My hammer is better.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I do not like you.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|This is for my followers!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You like that? I do!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Even my beard is angry!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Ahhh, hitting relieves stress.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|An iron will must be forged!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|This will ring nicely!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|You are a nail.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|The workisthe reward!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I will hit you until minerals fall out!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Nose, meet grindstone!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Nose! Meet grindstone!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|This is called building character!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I wasworking!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Good,yes!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Fighting is my first language.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|I have a hard head.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Enough!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Hold still!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|That's a whompin'!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Good!Yes!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Hammer never fails.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Now this I like!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I broke my beard...
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Well done...
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Buy a joke book. And a clown.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I now like you less. I did not think that was possible.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|No.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Stop it.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Problems solved.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Build it again. Correctly.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I've seen sturdier sandcastles.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Bad workmanship.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Shattered and melted.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Mortal craftsmanship,please.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Heheh, broke that real good.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Whoops. Found a flaw.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Too much sorcery, not enough elbow grease.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|It's always the magic parts that break.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Honestly, though, I was just leaning on it.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Heh, not one of mine.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Barely touched it.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Easy build, easy break.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|A strong sneeze would've had the same effect.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Demolished! Easy.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Spy on that.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|There, fixed that for you.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Was like that when I found it.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Not on my watch.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Early warning is key.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Heheh! Broke it real good.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Ahhh.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Job complete.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Fixed!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Back to work.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|That fixed everything.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Well, that happened.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Mhm. Yup. Dead.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|That's done.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Character built.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|It has not been a pleasure.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Nailed it.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Job done! Time to go home.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|That was more fun than I expected.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Could do without the statues.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Decent stonework.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Hmm...Noxiangranite. Respectable choice.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The architecture here is not wholly terrible.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Walls are fine.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Huh, loose cobblestone. Will fix later.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Singed fur... jealous blood... my brother is near!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I have fur. It is soft. Do not hug me.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... mmm.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... 'Hammer.'
wavs/audio_0085.wav|TheFreljordis a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home, sweet home.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Name's Ornn. No further pleasantries needed.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I will go over there. It looks quiet. It will be nice.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I am going this way. Do not follow me. Please.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I did not want to cool off, but this feels nice.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Volibear made the first river. You do not want to know how.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Hmm, this river needs a dam.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|It is childish to favor one tool over another! But Hammer is my favorite.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Bah, look at all these lazy trees.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|This world has potential. Needs hammering.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|I do not need company; only a wall, to keep out company.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I had followers once. They tried.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|A day away from my forge is a day wasted.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Luck is failure that failed.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|All I need is myself, and... Hammer.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer...
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I enjoy being alone. Fewer unintended casualties.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I will make an axe that is also a sword... and possibly a spoon.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|My forge is my home.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Solitude always meets my expectations.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|The last time I ate a plant was never.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins...
wavs/audio_0111.wav|'Ornn builds things, go see Ornn.' Nobody ever says thank you.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Everything is better when it is molten; lead, iron, chocolate cake.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Do not waste that.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Ornn tested, Ornn approved.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|A good axe will fell a tree. A great axe will fell an army.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The weapons I forge do not have names. They have ambitions.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|No exchanges.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|That is for wielding,notfor entertaining.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|You may be worthy of that. Do not prove me wrong.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I didn't make that. You didn't buy it.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Huh. You are not entirely an arse.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|You remind me of a young me, who was less impressive.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Working with you is almost like working alone. Almost.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Something you should know about me...
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I was looking at that one too.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Your job is not dying.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|This does not mean we are friends.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Do not hang that on a wall.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|If you want a weapon, here's a weapon. If you want conversation... here's a weapon.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|That is what good looks like.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|That's a weapon... you know, for fighting.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I trust you know how to use that.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|You will not be disappointed.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Hmm.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Good... yes.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I taughtDoraneverything he knows.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Hmm.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Hmm...
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Ahh.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Don't start without me!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Hot stuff!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|My horns are on the way!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Hooold!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I'm on my way. Stop asking.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|You each owe me a beer!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|You requested my aid!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Hooooold!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Incoming!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Hold!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Hold!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Horns first!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Everyone get behind me!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|This will be fun!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Ready for this?!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Fire up the forge!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Turn up the heat!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Fine! I will intervene!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|We fight now!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Into the fray!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Hmph. Never mind.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Changed my mind.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I didn't die. My forge missed me.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Rekindled the old furnace.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Still no water in the fountain.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|I'm used to this level of disappointment.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|'We're ready, Ornn, we'll be right behind you'...
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Good job, everyone.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Just leave everything to me, as usual.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|I do not care at all.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I do not care at all.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|This is a waste of my time.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|I don't know what you do and I don't care.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Your base is that way! Go cower in it.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Whatever you want, the answer is 'go away.'
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Here we go.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Efficient travel method. I approve.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Hmm, this is fast, but it can't be good for you.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|I swear, if Volibear is there...
wavs/audio_0181.wav|I prefer walking... but, fine.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Time to show them the horns.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|A fight's where I want to be.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|I love a surprise.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|I'll just drop by.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|They won't be ready for me.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|A good workman is needed.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|That hit the spot.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Whatever this drink is made of, it is working.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Fuel for the old hearth-fire.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Hmm, cherry flavored. Not bad.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Heyyy, this is pretty good stuff.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|I don't know how to feel about this thing, but okay.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Is it on?
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Hmm, that all it does? Okay.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|You stay here.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|I do not like surprises.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Fine, we go.
