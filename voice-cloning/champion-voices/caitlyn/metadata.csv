wavs/audio_0001.wav|Shall I turn in my badge and rifle as well?
wavs/audio_0002.wav|No hesitation!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Stay out of my way!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Do not move!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|No more cat-and-mouse.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|You cannot outrun your crimes!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Got them in my sights.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|In position.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Let's rack this up.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You won't escape!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I aim to win.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Up for a showdown?
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I'll make this quick.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Predictable.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Suspect engaged.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|This is where you yield!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Drop your weapons!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Surrender now!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Target in sight.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Can't leave this unsolved...
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I cannot let them down...
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Tell me my daughter...
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Excellent shot!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Think again.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Not so close.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I know you're hiding something, Camille. I just need to prove it.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Our values aren't so different, Ekko. Neither are Piltover and Zaun...
wavs/audio_0028.wav|There is more to life than chasing glory, Ezreal.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Am I to be the test subject for your latest invention, Heimerdinger?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Jayce, is this really the way to create a better tomorrow?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Is there a point to this madness, Jinx, or is it just a channel for your pain?
wavs/audio_0032.wav|(gasps) Seraphine! Would it be inappropriate to ask you for an autograph?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|This time, Urgot, I'll send you straight to prison myself.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I never thought I would stand opposite you again, Vi...
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Progress is essential to survival. But not like this, Viktor.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Aww, a Yordle. How cute.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Well, this is certainly interesting. Zac, was it?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Anything you say can and will be used against you.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I have all the evidence I need.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|This can only end with you behind bars.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I'll take you and your confession back to HQ.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Ready, aim... (gasps) Urgh! Why am I not surprised?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|You have the right to remain silent. I advise you use it.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Case closed.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Camille, I will not stop until I have all the answers.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I cannot change the past, Ekko. But together, we can create a better future.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Now, Ezreal, I'll take these artifacts as evidence.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|One down.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Ready to surrender yet?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|And so it begins.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I hope you achieved the results you wanted, Heimerdinger.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Our future will be bright, Jayce. I promise you.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Perhaps Piltover can rest easy without you, Jinx. But Vi...
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Well that's going to take a great deal of paperwork.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I was so looking forward to your next concert, Seraphine.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Perfect practice, precise results.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Let's move up.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Hardly what I'd call a defense.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Securing the perimeter.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Perimeter secured.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|A cell would've suited you much better, Urgot!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I never wanted this, Vi...
wavs/audio_0063.wav|This 'glorious evolution'... it will not be our fate, Viktor.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|There are easier ways to create a kinder world, Zac.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Tea time's over.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Open and shut.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|So, it has come to this.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Such a waste.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I would've preferred you in cuffs.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|An easy collar.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|On to the next case.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Guilty as charged.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|By the book.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I'll be keeping a close eye on you, Jinx. You've caused enough chaos as it is.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I'm glad you'll have my back, Vi. Let's keep the chaos to a minimum, shall we?
wavs/audio_0076.wav|My duty is to protect the citizens of Piltover, and I will see that through.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|So close to a breakthrough. All I must do is connect the dots.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I'm placing my trust in you lot. Let's see this case through... and try not to disappoint me.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|It's easy to overlook the rust beneath the gilding, but I never miss a detail.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Every case, every investigation brings me one step closer to justice.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|It should be progress, not power and fear, that leads Piltover into the future.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I ought to thank'C'for setting me on this path. Life in prison seems a proper gift, does it not?
wavs/audio_0083.wav|No matter the situation, a good investigator always remains calm.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|They cannot run from the long arm of the law... nor from the scope of my rifle.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|One must never start an investigation without first examining the evidence.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I always aim to win. And my aim is perfect.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I am not Piltover's dog. I work for its people, no one else.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Laws mean nothing when they fail to protect the public.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|The law bends for no one.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Hot on the trail.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Even the smallest clue can break a case.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I love a good chase.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I'm not here to serve. I'm here to protect.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I do love a good mystery.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Let's crack this case wide open.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Always maintain a proper chain of command.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I'll have this finished before tea time.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The heart of Piltover is its people.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I much prefer this to desk duty.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Someone call for a sheriff?
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I'm on the job.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I cannot afford to falter.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|It's my business to know what others do not.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Let's do this by the book.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|No stone left unturned.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Let's investigate.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Me, miss? Not by a long shot.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Never a dull moment.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|A true professional is always aware of her surroundings.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I will not tolerate lawlessness.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I must always be three steps ahead.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Brilliant!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|As expected.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Boom! Headshot.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Exemplary!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Immaculate!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I never miss.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|In my sights.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Steady...
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Calibrating...
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Taking aim.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|If crime never sleeps, then I'd best put on another pot of tea.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Do not disturb the crime scene until I return.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Be good while I'm gone, won't you?
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Much appreciated.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Thank you.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Cheers.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I'm back on the case! And this time I will not fail.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I'll be adding that to the charges.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|It seems I may have a new suspect...
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Think you're above the law? Think again.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Admitting your guilt? How generous.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Right where I want you.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Going somewhere?
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Got you!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Freeze!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Fancy a treat?
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Pay no attention to the trap.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Mind the trap.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I'm on the case.
