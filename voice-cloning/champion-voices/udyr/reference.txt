Gutless.
Abomination! I lay you to rest with no regret.
This... thing has no spirit. It is empty.
The spirits of dragons burn and roar long after they die.
This cavern is not your home, dragon. Why defend it?
Ribbit.
Alone, proud, feeling... hoppy?
This form... her prison.
Let me help you, Rift Herald.
I will put your gift to good use, protector.
Your protective nature shines through you, spirit.
I...We... live and die together as unshakable stone.
Stone-bodied, but with a living heart inside.
Hunger, gnawing, wild, wolven!
We smell blood on the air. A feast awaits!
Mother raptor, forgive my trespass.
I feelherneed to protect the nest.
I am sorry for what I must do, Scuttler.
Scuttlers are such gentle souls.
Bare your teeth.
Try meditating.
Silence your mind.
Novice!
No one survives life.
Struggle!
Pain brings focus.
Walk with me.
Strength of spirit!
I sense your fear.
Fist of Hirana!
Lightning strike!
Stain my claws!
Iron jab.
I stand my ground.
Lock horns with me!
Molten flow!
My rage runs cold.
Frozen fury.
Silence... at last...
The frost... is melting...
Blazing charge!
Awaken, ram!
Challenge me!
You cannot escape our inferno!
Ram spirit!
You cannot outrun me!
Speed!
You cannot stay above it all, great Frostbringer. If the Freljord dies, it won't rise again.
The Freljord would die in your hands, Ashe, broken beyond repair.
Thousands of spirits, screaming... silenced... warped! What are you?!
I have missed you, Lee. Let our spirits meld, let us spar.
Ice Witch, you are a blight on the Freljord! I will be its cure.
Weapons are often the tools of cowards, great forger.
Sejuani, do not make me your enemy. Please!
Arrgh! Stay out of my mind, Thousand-Pierced Bear!
Greetings are a waste of time.
I choose this fight.
Our fight will keep the Freljord alive.
Your hunger for battle is too weak to overcome me.
I am not good with people.
We will both grow from this.
I should not have left my pelt at home.
With your death, Ashe, the True Ice will not melt.
A great beast has been felled... without proper rites.
I venerate my kills. My enemies, they revel in theirs.
Thank you for refusing to strengthen my enemies!
My most worthy and most beloved opponent.
No peace for the Freljord!
Forgive me, Kalkia, I swore to protect your Sejuani, I...
I close my mind to you, great Valhir!
Fallow Fox keep you.
To take life... I do not do it lightly.
Your struggles are ended.
Balance is not always fair. I am... sorry.
A moment of silence.
The circle continues, unbroken, unwavering.
The spirits at the heart of the Freljord have need of me. I answer their call.
Hear me, spirits. I pray for struggle. I pray for growth.
I can taste our enemies' hunger for victory. Let them starve.
The beasts I channel within me are not me, but they are mine.
Wants and needs are not the same. Wants echo. Needs howl.
The Winter's Claw remembers the beast I once was... what I nearly did...
Kalkia helped me find myself. Lee helped me claim myself. Both good lessons.
My power deepened after a meal from that old woman. Almost feels like a Seal Sister tale!
War with theAvarosanswill end. Then my time, my life, will be my own again.
Sejuani'sboar, herTrue Ice, her people, her purpose... I will protect them all.
Yearsof training, and the needs of others still ring louder than my own!
Why, spirits? Why wasIchosen? For this struggle, will there ever be rest?
For many years I thought I was cursed. I still wonder.
Ordinary lives hold beauty.
I channel the spirits I feel closest to.
I am of no tribe.
The Seal Sister blesses with water and salt.
I do not fight alone.
Demigods cannot be trusted with balance.
Animals act on instinct, not choice.
My time inIoniataught me control.
This life is my burden, and my land's blessing.
Creatures of the Freljord walk in the footprints of the demigods.
Peace is not balance here.
Twice I have loved, twice I have left.
Following instinct alone is no way to live.
I do not channel the demigods.
I did nottrulyknow the Freljord until I left it.
Weapons are for the weak.
Great Seal Sister, guide my steps through treacherous waters.
TheWinter's Clawwas never my home.
A stagnant Freljord is a dead Freljord.
Bodies are not vessels. They are anchors.
A bear's strength is its joy. Its joy is strength.
I did not think I would like being an oathfather.
Joy and strength both crackle through me.
A boar's true shield is not its hide, but its will.
I am an unyielding protector, with iron armor and iron will.
The Iron Boar holds a grudge against the Fallow One.
As it nears its goal, the ram climbs faster.
Mastery is a volcano, and I will rise within it like magma.
Struggle, challenge, growth... hm, the marrow of life.
May we never know life without the frost.
Anger the phoenix, and feel its talons.
I enter the fray, anger in my heart and ice in my veins.
Our spark runs wild!
Awaken, bear!
Such a feast!
Lightning is not a single bolt, but a storm!
Strength!
Bear spirit!
Awaken, phoenix!
Save your tears!
Storm follow!
Frost and fury, our perfect storm!
Ice wind!
The storm rages through me!
Phoenix spirit!
Needs in the Freljord are loud. Meditations quiet my mind.
I see the world through the eyes of those I channel.
Each stance flows into the next like water.
Instinct led me one way. Training, another.
Must refocus.
Urgh, even in death, silence is brief.
Not yet, Fallow Fox.
Unshakable!
Our hide, our armor!
Awaken, boar!
No attack can bend our iron resolve!
Armor!
Boar spirit!
Conflict feeds theFreljord.
