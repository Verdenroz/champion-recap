Learn from your mistakes.
They've crossed the line.
So much death.
A necessary strike.
To serve the greater good.
Violence to end violence.
For those who were lost.
It must come to pass.
They cannot go unpunished!
The time for talk is over.
There is no other way.
I am awakened.
Ugh... I knew I should have sprung for the blade warranty.
This is why I spend so much time sheath shopping.
What conflict awaits?
My hands are stained.
Burdens of the past.
How should I proceed?
A sword mirrors its owner.
My spirit is not lost.
So long I've wandered...
Choose your own path.
Learn from your mistakes.
Leave doubt behind.
I know my purpose.
No looking back.
No more hesitation.
A moment of clarity.
I am awakened...
They cannot go unpunished...
The time for talk is over...
There is no other way...
Bleach
You are beyond redemption!
What is broken can be reforged.
