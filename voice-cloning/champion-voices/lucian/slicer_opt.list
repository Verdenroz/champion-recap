Lucian_Original_Attack_0.wav|lucian|en|You don't have the heart for this.
Lucian_Original_Attack_1.wav|lucian|en|I've faced worse.
Lucian_Original_Attack_2.wav|lucian|en|Don't duck on my account.
Lucian_Original_Attack_3.wav|lucian|en|Yeah, I got a cure for that.
Lucian_Original_Attack_4.wav|lucian|en|Plenty for all.
Lucian_Original_Attack_5.wav|lucian|en|Two in the head.
Lucian_Original_Attack_6.wav|lucian|en|Time to put you down.
Lucian_Original_Attack_7.wav|lucian|en|Here comes target practice.
Lucian_Original_Attack_8.wav|lucian|en|I don't do warning shots.
Lucian_Original_Attack_9.wav|lucian|en|How you see this goin'?
Lucian_Original_Attack_10.wav|lucian|en|Both guns blazin'.
Lucian_Original_Attack_11.wav|lucian|en|Have some peace.
Lucian_Original_Attack_12.wav|lucian|en|Ready for the beyond?
Lucian_Original_Attack_13.wav|lucian|en|Sorry I gotta do this.
Lucian_Original_Attack_14.wav|lucian|en|Got a death wish?
Lucian_Original_Attack_15.wav|lucian|en|Demonspawn!
Lucian_Original_Attack_16.wav|lucian|en|Always primed.
Lucian_Original_Attack_17.wav|lucian|en|Aimin' at you.
Lucian_Original_Attack_18.wav|lucian|en|Nothin' left but the end.
Lucian_Original_Attack_19.wav|lucian|en|Gonna need more coffins.
Lucian_Original_Attack_20.wav|lucian|en|Hope you brought your sidearm.
Lucian_Original_Attack_21.wav|lucian|en|Eat light.
Lucian_Original_Attack_22.wav|lucian|en|Thisismercy.
Lucian_Original_Attack_23.wav|lucian|en|Unclean.
Lucian_Original_Attack_24.wav|lucian|en|Nothin's pure anymore.
Lucian_Original_Attack_25.wav|lucian|en|Draw.
Lucian_Original_Attack_26.wav|lucian|en|Move aside, friend.
Lucian_Original_Attack_27.wav|lucian|en|Go on, scare me.
Lucian_Original_Attack_28.wav|lucian|en|Try your luck.
Lucian_Original_Attack_29.wav|lucian|en|Light 'em up.
Lucian_Original_Death_1.wav|lucian|en|Come get some.
Lucian_Original_Death_2.wav|lucian|en|I failed...
Lucian_Original_Death_3.wav|lucian|en|I'll... wait for her...
Lucian_Original_Death_4.wav|lucian|en|Senna...
Lucian_Original_Death_6.wav|lucian|en|Purity... and... peace...
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|lucian|en|Cleanse... me...
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|lucian|en|How's Demacia? All safe from the Mist? Yeah. You're welcome.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_2.wav|lucian|en|Hey, big fella! Try drinkin' fromthesebarrels.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_3.wav|lucian|en|Need me to wait while you reload that thing?
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_4.wav|lucian|en|Hey, gunslinger. I'll let you know if you hit somethin'.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_5.wav|lucian|en|You pointin' that peashooter at me? Let's dance.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounter_6.wav|lucian|en|A man can gettooclose to his horse, y'know.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterDemacians.wav|lucian|en|I ain't scared'a you, Hecarim. I just hate to put a good horse down.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterGragas.wav|lucian|en|Hey, pony man! You the one that left that pile over there?
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterGunChamps_0.wav|lucian|en|Nothin' I like more than a horse that ain't been broken.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterGunChamps_1.wav|lucian|en|Fortune. 'Fraid I can't help you outta thisHarrowing.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterGunChamps_2.wav|lucian|en|Let's crack you open, Mordekaiser, and see what's inside.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterHecarim_0.wav|lucian|en|Senna?! Ah, hell. If I'm gonna be shot, I'm glad it's by you.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterHecarim_1.wav|lucian|en|There she goes, the love of my life.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterHecarim_2.wav|lucian|en|Looks like we got ourselves a lovers' quarrel. Happy shootin', Senna.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterHecarim_3.wav|lucian|en|That you, Senna? Uh... is this about me not makin' the bed again?
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterMissFortune.wav|lucian|en|Lookin' for Thresh. You a friend of his?
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterMordekaiser.wav|lucian|en|If you don't have a heartbeat, you'd best not be movin'.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterSenna_0.wav|lucian|en|Whoever made you forgot to turn off the ugly.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterSenna_1.wav|lucian|en|Thresh. You're mine.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterSenna_2.wav|lucian|en|Got a little somethin' for that lantern: two barrels of righteous fury.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterSenna_3.wav|lucian|en|I haven't forgotten you, Thresh, and I sure as hell ain't forgivin'.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterShadowIsles_0.wav|lucian|en|'Chain Warden.' Mighty tall name for a sack of bones.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterShadowIsles_1.wav|lucian|en|Well, well. If it ain't the ugly low-down corpse that took my Senna.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterShadowIsles_2.wav|lucian|en|Someday we'll hunt monsters together, Vayne. But today, we'll hunt each other.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterThresh_0.wav|lucian|en|I ain't the monster you're lookin' for, Vayne, but I reckon Icanbe.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterThresh_1.wav|lucian|en|The Mist has you in a bad way, friend. Let me help.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterThresh_2.wav|lucian|en|You one'a them? Better kill ya to be safe.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterThresh_3.wav|lucian|en|One of us finds peace. One of us walks away.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterThreshWithSennaNear.wav|lucian|en|I got two good reasons for you to turn back.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterVayne_0.wav|lucian|en|Two guns, one you. Ain't likin' your odds.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterVayne_1.wav|lucian|en|Came to kill some ghouls. Guess you'll do.
Lucian_Original_FirstEncounterYorick.wav|lucian|en|Nothin' between you and me but gunlight.
Lucian_Original_HealWithSennaNear.wav|lucian|en|I'm just full of salvation. Come get it, friend.
Lucian_Original_Joke_0.wav|lucian|en|Thanks.
Lucian_Original_Joke_1.wav|lucian|en|And they say I have a grim sense of humor.
Lucian_Original_Joke_2.wav|lucian|en|Thisismy happy face... see?
Lucian_Original_Joke_3.wav|lucian|en|Smile? ...Alright.
Lucian_Original_Kill_0.wav|lucian|en|No, really... Iamsmiling.
Lucian_Original_Kill_1.wav|lucian|en|Yep. Reckon that's pure enough.
Lucian_Original_Kill_2.wav|lucian|en|For the light.
Lucian_Original_Kill_3.wav|lucian|en|Look at us making new memories.
Lucian_Original_Kill_4.wav|lucian|en|Sometimes, I see what the darkness is afraid of...
Lucian_Original_KillPenta.wav|lucian|en|Trust me, you're better off.
Lucian_Original_KillWithSennaNear_0.wav|lucian|en|Rise again, I dare you.
Lucian_Original_KillWithSennaNear_1.wav|lucian|en|Bullseyes.
Lucian_Original_KillWithSennaNear_2.wav|lucian|en|You best stay down!
Lucian_Original_Move_0.wav|lucian|en|They never get tired of dyin'.
Lucian_Original_Move_1.wav|lucian|en|You been kinda... distant since you came outta that lantern. Somethin' you ain't telling me?
Lucian_Original_Move_2.wav|lucian|en|How do you aim that thing? Isn't it heavy?
Lucian_Original_Move_3.wav|lucian|en|So what was it like? All that time in the lantern?
Lucian_Original_Move_4.wav|lucian|en|Reckon it's time-
Lucian_Original_Move_5.wav|lucian|en|TheMistawaits us all. Say goodbye to whatever you care about.
Lucian_Original_Move_6.wav|lucian|en|I got two guns. One's for what's in front of me, and one's for what's chasin'.
Lucian_Original_Move_7.wav|lucian|en|Ain't enough bullets in the world for all the killin' I'm about to do.
Lucian_Original_Move_8.wav|lucian|en|Look at 'em all. Not even knowin' they're following me to hell.
Lucian_Original_Move_9.wav|lucian|en|Fight's this way. If you're coming along, try not to die.
Lucian_Original_Move_10.wav|lucian|en|If I believed in something, I'd start prayin' to it right about now.
Lucian_Original_Move_11.wav|lucian|en|There's a right side and a wrong side to these guns. Don't wanna be on the wrong side.
Lucian_Original_Move_12.wav|lucian|en|Happiness is for other folks. Best I can hope for... is peace.
Lucian_Original_Move_13.wav|lucian|en|Huh. Strange place. Beats the hell out of theShadow Isles, though.
Lucian_Original_Move_14.wav|lucian|en|No place for feelings in this line of work. A full heart's an easy target.
Lucian_Original_Move_15.wav|lucian|en|So my wife is half dead. Not a problem. I'll just... love the half that isn't.
Lucian_Original_Move_16.wav|lucian|en|I'll sleep when they're good and dead.
Lucian_Original_Move_17.wav|lucian|en|Not too many problems a shot to the head can't fix.
Lucian_Original_Move_18.wav|lucian|en|Always save one shot for myself... just in case.
Lucian_Original_Move_19.wav|lucian|en|It's not the wraiths that haunt me, it's what could've been.
Lucian_Original_Move_20.wav|lucian|en|How do you kill what's already dead? With a fistful of gunlight.
Lucian_Original_Move_21.wav|lucian|en|Life... phew... it's a hell of a thing.
Lucian_Original_Move_22.wav|lucian|en|One shot for the years we lost, one for the love we can't get back.
Lucian_Original_Move_23.wav|lucian|en|Home is where I fight the dead.
Lucian_Original_Move_24.wav|lucian|en|When I kill 'em, they stay killed.
Lucian_Original_Move_25.wav|lucian|en|Don't need triggers, just need a target.
Lucian_Original_Move_26.wav|lucian|en|If you can't run from it, you might as well shoot it.
Lucian_Original_Move_27.wav|lucian|en|Some call it magic, I call it good aim.
Lucian_Original_Move_28.wav|lucian|en|Keep your guns out, and you'll never need to draw.
Lucian_Original_Move_29.wav|lucian|en|I can save her...I can save her...
Lucian_Original_Move_30.wav|lucian|en|People never really change... I need to believe that.
Lucian_Original_Move_31.wav|lucian|en|Sentinel. Fancy word for someone with nothing to lose.
Lucian_Original_Move_32.wav|lucian|en|You stare into the Mist, and the Mist stares back.
Lucian_Original_Move_33.wav|lucian|en|I've missed the smell of life.
Lucian_Original_Move_34.wav|lucian|en|It ain't the grave I fear... it's what crawls out of it.
Lucian_Original_Move_35.wav|lucian|en|I've always fought the Black Mist... never thought I'd be married to it.
Lucian_Original_Move_36.wav|lucian|en|Bravest thing I ever did, was getting up this morning.
Lucian_Original_Move_37.wav|lucian|en|What we had... can still be. I know it.
Lucian_Original_Move_38.wav|lucian|en|These guns run on fury. I never run out.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|lucian|en|No sunshine where I'm going.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|lucian|en|My wife's eyes glow with spectral magic... I'm sure it's fine.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|lucian|en|Now when I hold her, she feels... cold.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|lucian|en|This ain't war. Wars end.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|lucian|en|Nothing as painful as seeing something good... go bad.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|lucian|en|Spend this long around lost souls, and you're bound to lose your own.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirstWithSennaNear_0.wav|lucian|en|If I'm going down, I'm taking all those bastards with me.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirstWithSennaNear_1.wav|lucian|en|Used to think nothing was colder than death, now I know different.
Lucian_Original_MoveFirstWithSennaNear_2.wav|lucian|en|How are you supposed to grieve... when the thing you mourn comes back?
Lucian_Original_MoveFirstWithSennaNear_3.wav|lucian|en|Everyone I shoot is her captor. Everyone I save is her.
Lucian_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|lucian|en|Somethin' seems too good to be true? Probably is.
Lucian_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|lucian|en|Whatever's in the beyond... I hope it's better than this.
Lucian_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|lucian|en|I try to remember her the way she was... maybe it's best I don't.
Lucian_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|lucian|en|Seen so much death I don't even notice it anymore.
Lucian_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|lucian|en|You can cleanse anything... if you have the right ammunition.
Lucian_Original_R_0.wav|lucian|en|For Senna!
Lucian_Original_R_2.wav|lucian|en|Cleanse in fury!
Lucian_Original_R_3.wav|lucian|en|It ends here!
Lucian_Original_R_4.wav|lucian|en|Ashes and dust!
Lucian_Original_Recall_0.wav|lucian|en|Reckon I could use a rest, and a break from all the screamin'.
Lucian_Original_Recall_1.wav|lucian|en|A Sentinel's gotta know when to let his guns cool.
Lucian_Original_Recall_2.wav|lucian|en|Sometimes the smart thing to do is walk the hell away.
Lucian_Original_Recall_3.wav|lucian|en|Time to make like a wraith, and disappear.
Lucian_Original_Recall_4.wav|lucian|en|Right about now, I could use some purifyin' of my own.
Lucian_Original_Recall_5.wav|lucian|en|It ain't ever a sin to be careful.
Lucian_Original_Recall_6.wav|lucian|en|Can't run from trouble... sure can delay it for a spell though.
Lucian_Original_Respawn_0.wav|lucian|en|The shot that doesn't kill ya, sure makes you mad as hell.
Lucian_Original_Respawn_1.wav|lucian|en|The Mist won't take me yet.
Lucian_Original_Respawn_2.wav|lucian|en|Looks like no peace for me today.
Lucian_Original_Respawn_3.wav|lucian|en|Saw the beyond. Didn't like it much.
Lucian_Original_Respawn_4.wav|lucian|en|I ain't got time to die.
Lucian_Original_Respawn_5.wav|lucian|en|Oh, someone's gonna pay for that.
Lucian_Original_Taunt.wav|lucian|en|I'll have no trouble killing you, and less trouble killing you again.
Lucian_Original_TauntResponse_0.wav|lucian|en|We'll see how smart that mouth is when theHarrowingcomes.
Lucian_Original_TauntResponse_1.wav|lucian|en|Tough talk for worm food.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_Heal01_Chat02.wav|lucian|en|Getting used to it.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_Heal03_Chat02.wav|lucian|en|Could see how that would be preferable.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst01_Chat03.wav|lucian|en|Really?
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst02_Chat02.wav|lucian|en|What's to say? You're still cursed.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst03_Chat02.wav|lucian|en|Well... reckon I shoot something twice, and then you shoot it a third time.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst04_Chat03.wav|lucian|en|Oh. Ha, ha.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst05_Chat03.wav|lucian|en|'Cause I tried to... ohhhhh.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst06_Chat02.wav|lucian|en|I aim to purify.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst07_Chat02.wav|lucian|en|Try to be less beautiful.
Lucian_Original_WithSennaNear_MoveFirst07_Chat04.wav|lucian|en|Right. I'll keep up.
Lucian.move02.wav|lucian|en|Everybody dies. Some just need a little help.
