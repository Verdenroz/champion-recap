Afraid of the dark? Wise!
Your souls will feed the Void!
You shall not escape!
Who will be eaten first?
There will be no end to your suffering!
You have stains upon your soul... perfect.
You are such... hideous creatures!
No! I do not live under a bed! Fool!
Cho'Gath shrieks.
Cho'Gath shrieks.
Cho'Gath shrieks.
Cho'Gath shrieks.
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom!
Ah, the tangled webs we weave...
Cho'Gath laughs menacingly.
Cho'Gath laughs menacingly.
Cho'Gath laughs menacingly.
You... are a scourge upon the world.
The daylight! It burns!
Your voices are a scourge upon the world!
Summoner, your darkness beckons.
For the darkness!
I shall bring them terror!
Afraid of the dark? Wise!
Death... is not the end for you! I have seen to it: for eternity, you are mine!
You'd wish the world you know to end! Yeeeesssss...
