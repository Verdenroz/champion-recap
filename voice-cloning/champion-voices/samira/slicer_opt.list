Samira_Original_Attack_10.wav|samira|en|I fight on my terms.
Samira_Original_Attack_11.wav|samira|en|Next breath might be your last.
Samira_Original_Attack_12.wav|samira|en|Let's make this fun!
Samira_Original_Attack_13.wav|samira|en|Bah! Like Tereshni all over again.
Samira_Original_Attack_14.wav|samira|en|Push off.
Samira_Original_Attack_15.wav|samira|en|Oh lookie here. Target practice.
Samira_Original_Attack_16.wav|samira|en|Came all this way to die? Hm?
Samira_Original_Attack_17.wav|samira|en|You're mine.
Samira_Original_Attack_18.wav|samira|en|Seize the moment!
Samira_Original_Attack_19.wav|samira|en|Settle down sweet-cake.
Samira_Original_Attack_2.wav|samira|en|Don't mess with me.
Samira_Original_Attack_20.wav|samira|en|Well! Look at you.
Samira_Original_Attack_21.wav|samira|en|Think fast!
Samira_Original_Attack_3.wav|samira|en|I'll take care of this.
Samira_Original_Attack_4.wav|samira|en|And I'm not even looking.
Samira_Original_Attack_5.wav|samira|en|Finally some action!
Samira_Original_Attack_6.wav|samira|en|Always bet on me.
Samira_Original_Attack_7.wav|samira|en|I'm bored. Fight me!
Samira_Original_Attack_8.wav|samira|en|Don't hold back. I won't.
Samira_Original_Attack_9.wav|samira|en|Push my limits! I dare you.
Samira_Original_Death_1.wav|samira|en|Least I didn't die of boredom...
Samira_Original_Death_2.wav|samira|en|Style never fades...
Samira_Original_E_0.wav|samira|en|Over here!
Samira_Original_E_3.wav|samira|en|Eyes up!
Samira_Original_E_5.wav|samira|en|Too slow!
Samira_Original_E_6.wav|samira|en|Woo!
Samira_Original_E_7.wav|samira|en|Keep up!
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterAmumu.wav|samira|en|The sad mummy! My mﾄ［ﾄ］ used to tell stories about you when I was a girl. How I loved them.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterAzir.wav|samira|en|Shurima. Needs. No. Emperor!
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterDraven.wav|samira|en|I know your type, Draven. The kind of man who's compensating for something.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterEzreal.wav|samira|en|That gauntlet would be better off without you, kid.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterLeblanc.wav|samira|en|You seem kinda pale, LeBlanc. Sure you're getting enough sun?
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterMissFortune.wav|samira|en|Sarah, is it? I've killed many captains. Let's see how you measure up.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterRammus.wav|samira|en|A talking turtle? Okay, maybe I did have one too many.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterSivir.wav|samira|en|Sivir. You say you'll do anything for the right price, but what's the price of one's destiny?
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterSwain.wav|samira|en|Hey, old man. How long you got before that demon takes over?
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterThresh.wav|samira|en|Honestly, lantern man? Not sure you can handle my soul.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterVladimir.wav|samira|en|If it looks like a blood sucker and it sounds like a blood sucker... Maybe I ought to kill it.
Samira_Original_FirstEncounterXerath.wav|samira|en|Xerath. Your people ended my home. I will end your existence.
Samira_Original_JokeResponse.wav|samira|en|Ugh. I missed a freakin' cliff-diving trip for this crap?
Samira_Original_Joke_0.wav|samira|en|Hm. How come no one ever tells me to reload?
Samira_Original_Joke_1.wav|samira|en|Oh... I really gotta check these more often.
Samira_Original_Joke_2.wav|samira|en|Huh. Less than yesterday at least.
Samira_Original_KillAmumu.wav|samira|en|Eh, I'm not here to make friends.
Samira_Original_KillAzir.wav|samira|en|Don't worry, Azir. You'll be remembered... as a tyrant.
Samira_Original_KillCondescending.wav|samira|en|Maybe you should've smiled more.
Samira_Original_KillDraven.wav|samira|en|Ah... what was your dumb name again?
Samira_Original_KillEzreal.wav|samira|en|Leave the kid, take the gauntlet.
Samira_Original_KillLeBlanc.wav|samira|en|Not the first LeBlanc I've killed. Probably not the last, either.
Samira_Original_KillMissFortune.wav|samira|en|Your guns have a better home now Sarah.
Samira_Original_KillPenta.wav|samira|en|Ohoho I'm just getting started!
Samira_Original_KillRammus.wav|samira|en|Not sure if I just killed an ascended or some kid's lost pet. Ah, well.
Samira_Original_KillSivir.wav|samira|en|Guess you don't need to run from destiny anymore, Sivir.
Samira_Original_KillSwain.wav|samira|en|Be thankful I got to you before your demon did.
Samira_Original_KillThresh.wav|samira|en|Don't say I didn't warn you lantern man.
Samira_Original_KillVladimir.wav|samira|en|Ugh, gross. Least my boots are looking brighter.
Samira_Original_KillXerath.wav|samira|en|Shurima, no, the world is better off without you, Xerath.
Samira_Original_Kill_0.wav|samira|en|Not sorry.
Samira_Original_Kill_1.wav|samira|en|Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Samira_Original_Kill_2.wav|samira|en|Idiot.
Samira_Original_Kill_3.wav|samira|en|Ha! I win.
Samira_Original_Kill_4.wav|samira|en|Flawless.
Samira_Original_Kill_5.wav|samira|en|My time is precious. Your life is not.
Samira_Original_Kill_6.wav|samira|en|Lucky for you the last thing you saw was me.
Samira_Original_Kill_7.wav|samira|en|Done and dusted.
Samira_Original_Kill_8.wav|samira|en|Messy, but effective.
Samira_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|samira|en|I've got two rules for every fight. Don't ask for permission, don't ask for forgiveness.
Samira_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|samira|en|Listen up, you sorry lot! Only one rule for this mission: take no prisoners.
Samira_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|samira|en|If you can't keep up don't step up. I don't have time for fools.
Samira_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|samira|en|Name's Samira. Try not to slow me down.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|samira|en|People always ask about my weapons. Right hand, Blaze. Left hand, Thorn. Vanquish on the back, eh! Simple as that.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|samira|en|Growing up, my mﾄ［ﾄ］ taught me one lesson. Death isn't the scariest thing. It's a mother's rage.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|samira|en|I care most about my warband or my family. Order changes depending on who gets on my nerves.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|samira|en|Born in Shurima, raised by Noxus. Maybe I'll die in Demacia to make things interesting, huh?
Samira_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|samira|en|Sometimes, I'm the hero. Other times, I'm the villain. It's all a matter of perspective.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|samira|en|Those who followed the ascended burned away my home. So don't expect me to follow anyone.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|samira|en|Indari was a great captain. She taught me how to shoot. I taught myself how to kill.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|samira|en|Darius, Swain, pft! Those names mean little to me. I answer to myself.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_8.wav|samira|en|If they think I kill for fame and fortune, ha! They're idiots, just like all the others.
Samira_Original_MoveLong_9.wav|samira|en|I chose this life. And sure, someday it might get me killed... but 'til then, I'm unstoppable.
Samira_Original_Move_0.wav|samira|en|I'm the rose that survived the desert.
Samira_Original_Move_1.wav|samira|en|Danger runs from me.
Samira_Original_Move_10.wav|samira|en|Money buys a gun or two. Thrill buys a reputation.
Samira_Original_Move_11.wav|samira|en|Guns and swords go together like rice and saffron.
Samira_Original_Move_12.wav|samira|en|I don't work. I slay.
Samira_Original_Move_13.wav|samira|en|The empire values strength. I value style. We're good partners.
Samira_Original_Move_14.wav|samira|en|Hope I get some blood on these boots. The color's a bit dull.
Samira_Original_Move_15.wav|samira|en|I feel most alive when I'm walking the line.
Samira_Original_Move_16.wav|samira|en|Only need one eye to hit my mark.
Samira_Original_Move_17.wav|samira|en|Well-behaved women don't make it in Noxus.
Samira_Original_Move_18.wav|samira|en|Life's simple. Take the shot or lose the chance.
Samira_Original_Move_19.wav|samira|en|The ascended think they own my people. They are wrong.
Samira_Original_Move_2.wav|samira|en|In every girl, there is a queen.
Samira_Original_Move_20.wav|samira|en|Last person I loved thought I was too reckless. Their loss.
Samira_Original_Move_21.wav|samira|en|Why be average when I can be savage?
Samira_Original_Move_22.wav|samira|en|Oh, how great it would feel to shoot my past in the face.
Samira_Original_Move_23.wav|samira|en|Thrilling! Ha! Maybe I'll get a tattoo to celebrate the occasion.
Samira_Original_Move_24.wav|samira|en|Style
Samira_Original_Move_3.wav|samira|en|Heh! Nothing more lethal than comfort.
Samira_Original_Move_4.wav|samira|en|Some choose steel. Others, bullets. Why not both?
Samira_Original_Move_5.wav|samira|en|and
Samira_Original_Move_6.wav|samira|en|My folks keep telling me to settle down. Not my style.
Samira_Original_Move_7.wav|samira|en|'Refugee.' That label is where I draw my strength.

Samira_Original_Move_9.wav|samira|en|Virtues? I've got a few. Vices? Heh, a few more.
Samira_Original_RReadyBuff_0.wav|samira|en|It's about to get messy.
Samira_Original_RReadyBuff_1.wav|samira|en|Never look back!
Samira_Original_RReadyBuff_2.wav|samira|en|Weapons hot!
Samira_Original_R_0.wav|samira|en|My kind of rain!
Samira_Original_R_2.wav|samira|en|No better time to die!
Samira_Original_Recall_0.wav|samira|en|How did that old trick go again? Ah, right.
Samira_Original_Recall_1.wav|samira|en|Taking a quick break. Try not to die while I'm gone.
Samira_Original_Recall_2.wav|samira|en|This took years of practice... for everyone else.
Samira_Original_Respawn_0.wav|samira|en|Look out, guys, gals, and other pals. Samira's back!
Samira_Original_Respawn_1.wav|samira|en|Live fast. Die young.
