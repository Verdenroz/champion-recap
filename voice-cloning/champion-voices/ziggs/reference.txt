Fuses burning, fuses burning!
Explosion first, questions later.
Fire in the hole!

Lights out!
Bombs away!
Take cover!

Hey... where'd that bomb go?
Impatient? I'm not impatient.
Right-o!
I love the smell of explosives in the morning
Let's blow this joint.
What do you mean this doesn't look safe?
Anyone got a... match?
Don't worry, I got this.
Come on... come on, come on!
Wah-hah!
Woo!
Ooh, look out below!
I bring the Big One!
Yeee-haaa!
Incoming!
Ohohoho, yeah!
I'll take this one, and this one, andâ€”throw it in your face!
I like my enemies, like I like my bombs:about to explode!
Wah-hah!
Woo!
