You don't have to be afraid of me.
Unleashed, but in control!
I'm famished.
Shall we?
You're my prey now.
I see all that you are.
Don't tempt me.
Just a taste.
The hunter and the hunted.
This flavor...
Eyes on me.
Don't be afraid.
I don't play with my food.
My true nature.
I see right through you.
I cannot be tamed!
I am the wild.
You think you can win?
Self-hatred? Far from it.
Tell me a secret.
Remember this.
My ancestors die with me...
Maybe I'll see him again...
Will I also be forgotten...?
You're mine now.
Give me your heart!
I don't bite... much.
Got you!
You're safe with me.
Come here often?
Mwah!
Come closer!
Oh, don't go.
Braum, your heart is like a warm blanket in a winter storm.
Our destiny still awaits us, Illaoi.
I am no longer lost, Lillia. Nor do I still want to forget.
Revenge will consume you, Captain. Don't lose yourself like I did.
Have I finally made your list, Pyke?
Rakan, you and Xayah are two sides of the same heart.
I finally understand what it means to be vastaya: we are the bridge between realms.
I know who I am now, Xayah, and I know what I need to do.
Yasuo! I knew fate would bring us together again.
Your brother faced his demons, Yone. Time to face yours.
I won't lose myself to you!
Don't bother running, I'm faster.
I'll make your last moments matter.
I'll show you what I'm made of!
You're not afraid of me, are you?
I'll give you the freedom you desire!
Oh, you were trying to be funny? Cute.
Two tails are better than one. Or, well... you know.
Your warmth... I'll keep it close to my heart, Braum.
Illaoi, all paths led us to this moment.
Your dreams were beautiful, Lillia.
It isn't weak to move forward, Sarah. It takes strength.
Felt good to let loose!
We are what our natures demand. Right, Pyke?
Xayah will miss you, Rakan.
I'll keep searching to find others like us.
Xayah, in a different life, we could've been great friends.
The wind may die, Yasuo, but only for a moment.
Yone, I too wear the mask of a monster. But that doesn't need to define us.
You certainly led an...interesting life.
Hmm, a little bitter for my taste.
Life is shorter than you think.
Thank you for indulging me.
I'll cherish these memories forever.
I would never let you suffer.
Refreshing!
Let's go!
Once more!
I'm older than all of you combined. At least, I think I am.
I know this place... Some part of me remembers.
I'm not alone anymore. I can trust in others, and in myself.
I've fought alongside some of the best, you know. So... try to keep up.
Whatever new experiences await me today, I'll meet them head-on.
I've wasted an eternity standing still. It's time to move forward.
Let's create new memories together.
The trail the Vesani left... I'll follow it where it takes me, and then forge my own path.
It took me too long to realize how beautiful life can be.
To stay strong, I hunt. But I'm no longer afraid of losing control.
The friends I've made are very... strange... in a cute way.
He truly loved me, saw me for all that I am. I'llneverforget that.
If I look back now, it's only to see how far I've come.
Memories are no longer mine to steal. They're mine to make.
There's beauty in even the most painful memories.
This forest brings me back to my days as a kit, running with the ice foxes.
I will always have regrets, but I won't keep running from them.
I'll seeeverythingthis world has to offer.
The air smells so much sweeter without the Black Mist.
Humans change over days. Nature, over centuries.
I love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.
The Vesani left so much behind. I will find it all.
I've met so many new people, every one of them unique.
Hidden away for so long, it's nice to finally feel the sun.
Though I've been around for a while, every day brings something new.
No more holding back. I go after what I deserve.
Never imagined this is the path my life would take.
I lived—and live—an eternity.
Every animal hungers for something.
As the seasons change, so do I.
A body nourished, a soul fed.
Nature here is too quiet.
I won't forget what it means to steal a life.
Remember this moment.
So much I want to see for myself.
Like this forest, I am wild.
So many memories stir within me.
This place reminds me of home.
I carry the legacy of the Vesani.
I'm living my best life.
I still remember his laugh...
There's beauty in even the smallest moments.
I'll have them chasing their tails!
The world is mine to discover.
I should've left home years ago.
I hear the wind singing.
Live with no regrets.
Mortal lives are so fleeting.
Delicious!
Refreshing!
How sweet!
Just for you!
Feel this!
Catch!
Here I come!
What a rush!
Breathtaking!
Run wild!
Can't outrun a fox.
Don't worry. We'll be back soon enough.
Oh, there you are! Come to see new sights with me?
Everything's more fun together, don't you think?
I'll remember that, you know.
Not even cloud fruit could erase that memory.
I may have nine tails, but I have unlimited lives.
Well, that was an experience. Not my favorite.
I see all that you desire. Rawr!
I've seen your most embarrassing moments, you know.
Let's run.
Quick as a fox!
Light on my feet.
A clever fox is never caught.
