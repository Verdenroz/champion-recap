wavs/audio_0002.wav|My... that's a lot of pain.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|The bigger they are, the more places you can hurt them.

wavs/audio_0018.wav|Love at first sight... And last.

wavs/audio_0036.wav|My pleasure, your pain.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Let me see you hurt.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Everyone's pain tastes different. What flavor is yours?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Shut up and scream.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Hey there.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Nothing personal, I just need you to suffer horribly.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Like what you see? I'll rip off your eyelids!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Yes... Yes...!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I know you're hurting, but I can't feel without this.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Beg me to stop.

wavs/audio_0049.wav|Your fear is delightful.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Enough foreplay!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Awww, you thought you were getting lucky!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Don't die wishing you'd had this.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Sealed with a kiss.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Ooh la la!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Wanna get outta here?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I can't wait to see your pain face.

wavs/audio_0098.wav|Why not give them something to take off?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I prefer going naked but... okay.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|It's a sin to cover something so perfect.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I prefer going naked but... okay.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|It's a sin to cover something so perfect.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Why not give them something to take off?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I do like your style, Liandry, whoever you were.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Aahh, still wet with the tears of Liandry herself.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Now, they will all know true pain.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Aahh, still wet with the tears of Liandry herself.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I do like your style, Liandry, whoever you were.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Now, they will all know true pain.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Even a lich can suffer.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|The pain of a lich is eternal.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|The pain of a lich is eternal.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Even a lich can suffer.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|This land will become a sea of torment.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Hello, hat. Ready to feast on the pain of others?
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Hello, hat. Ready to feast on the pain of others?
wavs/audio_0117.wav|This land will become a sea of torment.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Think of all the places this can go.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|It's so... big.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Imagine what we can do with this.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Imagine what we can do with this.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Think of all the places this can go.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|It's so... big.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|One last... kiss...
wavs/audio_0125.wav|I thought... we had something...
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Goodbye, love...
wavs/audio_0127.wav|So this... is... pain?
wavs/audio_0128.wav|So this... is... pain?

wavs/audio_0130.wav|One last... kiss...
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I thought... we had something...
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Ugh, I wouldn't torture you if you were the last person on earth.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|What's the point of torturing you?
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Ugh, I wouldn't torture you if you were the last person on earth.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|What's the point of torturing you?
wavs/audio_0136.wav|With infinite power comes an infinite capacity for pain.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|With infinite power comes an infinite capacity for pain.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I can make you do a lot more than jingle, space man.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|I can make you do a lot more than jingle, space man.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Does that... hurt?
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Does that... hurt?

wavs/audio_0143.wav|So, you're a masochist? What'cha doing later?
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Can your kind even feel? I don't want to waste my time.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Can your kind even feel? I don't want to waste my time.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Blindfolds, huh? Whatever does it for ya.

wavs/audio_0154.wav|Why don't we leave the lights on for this?
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Why don't we leave the lights on for this?
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I like your style, Kench, but stay out of my territory.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|So how are you, River King? I see you haven't missed a meal.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|So how are you, River King? I see you haven't missed a meal.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|I like your style, Kench, but stay out of my territory.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|You look like someone I could hurt for days.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|You look like someone I could hurt for days.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|How do you kill them so slowly? You have to teach me.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Ooh, I love watching you work.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Ooh, I love watching you work.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|How do you kill them so slowly? You have to teach me.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Don't worry, love. You'll join them soon.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Have I told you how your parents cried with their final breaths?
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Have I told you how your parents cried with their final breaths?
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Don't worry, love. You'll join them soon.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|That skin looks good on you, but it would look better on my bedroom floor.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|First time being tortured? Don't worry, I'll do everything.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I've had my eye on you. *giggles* Now I'm gonna rip yours out.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|I'll suck every last drop of joy from your heart.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|I don't really have friends. Just people I haven't eviscerated yet.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|I'll suck every last drop of joy from your heart.

wavs/audio_0180.wav|I love it when they talk dirty. 'No! Please! Stop torturing me!'
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Know what else is funny? Pulling your tongue out through your neck.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Know what else is funny? Pulling your tongue out through your neck.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|I love it when they talk dirty. 'No! Please! Stop torturing me!'
wavs/audio_0184.wav|No, no! Don't die yet!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Aw, playtime's over.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|That was fast.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Wanna do it again?
wavs/audio_0188.wav|I hate it when they don't last.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Oh well... Time to find a new toy.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Was it as good for you as it was for me? No? Too bad!
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Look at me! I need to watch you go.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Ugh... I think we should break up.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Ugh... I thought you'd last longer.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|We need to talk. I want to kill other people.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|That was hot.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|It's okay, hun, happens to everyone.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Was it as good for you as it was for me? No? Too bad!
wavs/audio_0199.wav|We need to talk. I want to kill other people.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|I hate it when they don't last.

wavs/audio_0210.wav|Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|No, no! Don't die yet!
wavs/audio_0212.wav|This place is so bland. It needs a splash of red.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|The moment they think they have me... *laughs* Yeah, that's what I live for.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Let's see... whose life shall I ruin today?
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Oooh, so many joyful people to hurt.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Show me the man who has everything, and I'll show you my next victim.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Suffering is the meaning of life. Well...theirlives.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Don't try to tell me I'm not gorgeous.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I hurt them 'til they hurt no more.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|I like the happy ones. They have so much farther to fall.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Hate and love are just two words for passion.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|I can't feel anything... until they do.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Ah, how their screams make me tingle.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|I don't break hearts. I just tear them from rib cages.
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Every kill is just a lover who didn't work out.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|People have too many emotions. What am I supposed to do with  ?
wavs/audio_0227.wav|♪ Rend their flesh, flay them head to toe. ♪
wavs/audio_0228.wav|This craving will soon be sated.
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Through suffering they come to love me. Every. Single. One.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Keep them longing, make them plead.
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Once I was overwhelmed by the agony. Now I can't get enough.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Let's see... something to fill the emptiness...
wavs/audio_0233.wav|Just looking for that special someone to torment.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|I remember when just a little pain did the trick.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|They love to watch me leave.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|You really don't know someone 'til you've seen them beg for mercy.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Someday they'll love me for who I really am.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|One touch, with desire... that's all I need.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|I was born of a thousand screams. What's one more?
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Who does a girl have to kill to start another Rune War?
wavs/audio_0241.wav|The height of their happiness is the depth of their pain.
wavs/audio_0242.wav|My love cuts to the quick.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Their mouths say no, but their bodies say
wavs/audio_0244.wav|They're all my favorites... until they break.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|I only do one night stands.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|A man once told me to put on some clothes. So I wore his skin.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|Human. Agony. My two favorite words.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|I use every part of their torment. Nothing is wasted.
wavs/audio_0249.wav|Drink the pain, toss away the rest.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|These curves are real.
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Without pain, how could we know joy?
wavs/audio_0252.wav|I tasted peace once. Didn't do it for me.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Hate? No! I hurt them out of love.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|I feel their looks like hot breath. They feel my claws like hot knives.
wavs/audio_0255.wav|Need to find me? Just follow the trail of widows.
wavs/audio_0256.wav|Always dress like you're seducing your next victim.
wavs/audio_0257.wav|All my exes are dead.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Every smile is just a frown waiting to be turned upside down.
wavs/audio_0259.wav|I feel their looks like hot breath. They feel my claws like hot knives.

wavs/audio_0305.wav|It's better in the dark.
wavs/audio_0306.wav|The night is my veil.
wavs/audio_0307.wav|Lights out.
wavs/audio_0308.wav|What they don't know won't hurt them... yet.
wavs/audio_0309.wav|Oooh, I like to watch.
wavs/audio_0310.wav|Let's sneak around.
wavs/audio_0311.wav|The things we whisper in the dark.
wavs/audio_0312.wav|They can touch, but they can't look.
wavs/audio_0313.wav|Stalk and seduce.
wavs/audio_0314.wav|Play more later?
wavs/audio_0315.wav|Don't go anywhere.
wavs/audio_0316.wav|I'm not done yet.

wavs/audio_0320.wav|Be right back. Gotta put my face on.
wavs/audio_0321.wav|Show's over, boys.
wavs/audio_0322.wav|Always leave them wanting more.
wavs/audio_0323.wav|Mind if I slip into something a little more... painful?
wavs/audio_0324.wav|A girl's gotta know when to disappear.
wavs/audio_0325.wav|Love 'em and leave 'em.
wavs/audio_0326.wav|Be right back. Gotta put my face on.
