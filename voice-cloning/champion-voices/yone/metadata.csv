wavs/audio_0001.wav|You thinkIam the one to fear? Hmph.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|This is your remedy!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You can't flee your fears!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|You force my hand!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Such a burdened soul!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Unworthy of my blades!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Regrets hold you back!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I'm not here for you!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Inner demons, hmph.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|No time for sympathy!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Aren't you a haunted one?
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Carve away doubt!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Out of my way!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Relinquish your burdens!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Strike true!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Yield, or fall to my blades!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Your fight is with yourself!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|What must be done!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Steel and spirit!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I am not the enemy.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Everyone wears masks!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I will save you from yourself!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Relent!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Weighed down by fear!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Bound by your insecurities!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|They always resist redemption!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|It's too late for you!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Your doubt betrays you!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Another... failure...
wavs/audio_0030.wav|It... consumes me...
wavs/audio_0031.wav|No respite! No... release...
wavs/audio_0032.wav|A familiar... embrace...
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Defeated? Hardly...
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Begone.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Excised.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Farewell.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Nowhere to hide!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Spirit unmoored!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Cross the veil!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Perhaps you can charm some sense into my foolish brother, Ahri.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Unhaunted, unworthy of my time!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Evelynn. A sugary mask for such a master of agony.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|What ancient horror is this?  Is... is this what an Azakana could become?!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I have fallen outside your cycle, Lamb and Wolf. Are you here to usher me back?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Kled... who hurt you?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|A comfort to see you, Lillia, after so many Azakana...
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Do not wish to hide behind masks, Lillia. Yours... is a kind face.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Living nightmare! I will end you before you cross paths with the dream fawn!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Guilt clings to you, Riven. Forgive yourself, or the Azakanawillfind you.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Balance is a delusion, Shen. Surely you see that now.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Grafted to a demon by choice? What a grand fool!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Tahm Kench. Two-Coats. I know your true name, demon!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Taliyah, the one you call master is a fool!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Is that the taste of salt on the wind?  Ah... hello, brother.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Brother, our paths cross once again. Will our swords do the same?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|An innocent spirit! I'd... almost forgotten those existed!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I will take no joy in cutting you down!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Blink, and you'll miss your own death!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Two paths cross. One, condemned to end.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Ah, to be blind to the true dangers of this world!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|A walkingfeastfor Azakana!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Such bravado! But you're fooling no one.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I know your name.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Death rejected me, but I'm sure it will welcome you!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Ah, eating. How I miss it.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Ah, eating. How I miss it.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Their fates, sealed by my hand!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|If only you'd listened!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Too far gone...
wavs/audio_0070.wav|May your spirit find the peace you did not.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Another Azakana, sealed.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Huh.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Hmph.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Heh.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Before, I chased a wayward gale. Now I hunt a storm of darkness.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Many mistake me for the nightmares I slay. Hmph, let them.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|In this cursed second life, where does the mask end, and I begin?
wavs/audio_0078.wav|They look at me and see only the mask.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|TheAzakanahave spread like a plague since theNoxian invasion. My work ... never ends.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Wear a mask long enough... and you forget the face beneath.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|On a cliff by the sea, I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Through the mask, I see their truths laid bare. Yet my own... ...dance, just out of reach...
wavs/audio_0083.wav|A broken heart, an anxious mind, all can attract the Azakana.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Azakana trap their victims in a vicious cycle of emotion. Doubt breeds doubt, fear breeds fear, and the Azakana feasts.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Long before blades and sorcery are needed, words... can save a soul.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|So many try to flee their burdens. Fleeing is impossible!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Bound to the world of the living... Denied the peace of death.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Every aspect of an Azakana is a stroke. Each stroke forms a character, revealing their true name...
wavs/audio_0089.wav|One blade carries the weight of my past. The other, holds the key to my future...
wavs/audio_0090.wav|When we met in the Spirit Realm, this Azakana upon my face knew me!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Azakana lurk everywhere. I will end their depredations.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Some days I forget what lies behind this mask.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Honor once bound me above all else.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Fear, once named, controls no one.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I do what must be done.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|What does one do with an abundance of masks?
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Forgiveness is... complicated.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The hunt... it never ends.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Without a banquet of sorrow, an Azakana starves.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|No sleep, no rest... there is no time.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Rare is the person who shows their true face.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The haunted cower behind polite fictions.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Azakana abound.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Between uncertainty and fear, the Azakana prowl.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Walk both realms.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Humans lie. Swords... speak truth.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Demons take many forms, I hunt them all the same.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|TheSpirit Realmis... strange. A mirror, an inverse, of our own.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I do not hunt to kill!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|No fate, nor destiny. Only tomorrow.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Now, there is only the hunt.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Sometimes, to save someone, you must fight them.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I'm not here to save their souls.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|O'sai!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Kuo'an!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Kase'ton!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Piercing winds!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Storm of blades!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Steel gale!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|My blades know your name!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Let's end this!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|A respite, to return the sealed to their rightful place.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|The more I seal away... the more they seem to multiply!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|With each mask I claim, I come one step closer to understanding my own.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Now... it's a little personal.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|When will I know peace?
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I thought death would grant me peace. Hmph... how na√Øve.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Not enough to stop me.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Every time it's no less strange... nor less painful.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Mmh... back to the hunt.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Azakana, once named... can be bound.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Carve the spirit!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Cut through lies!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Severed!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Cast out!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|One to cut, one to seal.
