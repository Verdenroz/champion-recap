You thinkIam the one to fear? Hmph.
This is your remedy!
You can't flee your fears!
You force my hand!
Such a burdened soul!
Unworthy of my blades!
Regrets hold you back!
I'm not here for you!
Inner demons, hmph.
No time for sympathy!
Aren't you a haunted one?
Carve away doubt!
Out of my way!
Relinquish your burdens!
Strike true!
Yield, or fall to my blades!
Your fight is with yourself!
What must be done!
Steel and spirit!
I am not the enemy.
Everyone wears masks!
I will save you from yourself!
Relent!
Weighed down by fear!
Bound by your insecurities!
They always resist redemption!
It's too late for you!
Your doubt betrays you!
Another... failure...
It... consumes me...
No respite! No... release...
A familiar... embrace...
Defeated? Hardly...
Begone.
Excised.
Farewell.
Nowhere to hide!
Spirit unmoored!
Cross the veil!
Perhaps you can charm some sense into my foolish brother, Ahri.
Unhaunted, unworthy of my time!
Evelynn. A sugary mask for such a master of agony.
What ancient horror is this?  Is... is this what an Azakana could become?!
I have fallen outside your cycle, Lamb and Wolf. Are you here to usher me back?
Kled... who hurt you?
A comfort to see you, Lillia, after so many Azakana...
Do not wish to hide behind masks, Lillia. Yours... is a kind face.
Living nightmare! I will end you before you cross paths with the dream fawn!
Guilt clings to you, Riven. Forgive yourself, or the Azakanawillfind you.
Balance is a delusion, Shen. Surely you see that now.
Grafted to a demon by choice? What a grand fool!
Tahm Kench. Two-Coats. I know your true name, demon!
Taliyah, the one you call master is a fool!
Is that the taste of salt on the wind?  Ah... hello, brother.
Brother, our paths cross once again. Will our swords do the same?
An innocent spirit! I'd... almost forgotten those existed!
I will take no joy in cutting you down!
Blink, and you'll miss your own death!
Two paths cross. One, condemned to end.
Ah, to be blind to the true dangers of this world!
A walkingfeastfor Azakana!
Such bravado! But you're fooling no one.
I know your name.
Death rejected me, but I'm sure it will welcome you!
Ah, eating. How I miss it.
Ah, eating. How I miss it.
Their fates, sealed by my hand!
If only you'd listened!
Too far gone...
May your spirit find the peace you did not.
Another Azakana, sealed.
Huh.
Hmph.
Heh.
Before, I chased a wayward gale. Now I hunt a storm of darkness.
Many mistake me for the nightmares I slay. Hmph, let them.
In this cursed second life, where does the mask end, and I begin?
They look at me and see only the mask.
TheAzakanahave spread like a plague since theNoxian invasion. My work ... never ends.
Wear a mask long enough... and you forget the face beneath.
On a cliff by the sea, I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams.
Through the mask, I see their truths laid bare. Yet my own... ...dance, just out of reach...
A broken heart, an anxious mind, all can attract the Azakana.
Azakana trap their victims in a vicious cycle of emotion. Doubt breeds doubt, fear breeds fear, and the Azakana feasts.
Long before blades and sorcery are needed, words... can save a soul.
So many try to flee their burdens. Fleeing is impossible!
Bound to the world of the living... Denied the peace of death.
Every aspect of an Azakana is a stroke. Each stroke forms a character, revealing their true name...
One blade carries the weight of my past. The other, holds the key to my future...
When we met in the Spirit Realm, this Azakana upon my face knew me!
Azakana lurk everywhere. I will end their depredations.
Some days I forget what lies behind this mask.
Honor once bound me above all else.
Fear, once named, controls no one.
I do what must be done.
What does one do with an abundance of masks?
Forgiveness is... complicated.
The hunt... it never ends.
Without a banquet of sorrow, an Azakana starves.
No sleep, no rest... there is no time.
Rare is the person who shows their true face.
The haunted cower behind polite fictions.
Azakana abound.
Between uncertainty and fear, the Azakana prowl.
Walk both realms.
Humans lie. Swords... speak truth.
Demons take many forms, I hunt them all the same.
TheSpirit Realmis... strange. A mirror, an inverse, of our own.
I do not hunt to kill!
No fate, nor destiny. Only tomorrow.
Now, there is only the hunt.
Sometimes, to save someone, you must fight them.
I'm not here to save their souls.
O'sai!
Kuo'an!
Kase'ton!
Piercing winds!
Storm of blades!
Steel gale!
My blades know your name!
Let's end this!
A respite, to return the sealed to their rightful place.
The more I seal away... the more they seem to multiply!
With each mask I claim, I come one step closer to understanding my own.
Now... it's a little personal.
When will I know peace?
I thought death would grant me peace. Hmph... how na√Øve.
Not enough to stop me.
Every time it's no less strange... nor less painful.
Mmh... back to the hunt.
Azakana, once named... can be bound.
Carve the spirit!
Cut through lies!
Severed!
Cast out!
One to cut, one to seal.
