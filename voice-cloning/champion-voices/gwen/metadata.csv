wavs/audio_0001.wav|Why not? My scissors don't bite.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Oh, joy!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Looking for a tailor?
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Pure bliss!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|You don't frighten me!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Cut fast, cut strong!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Here's a sewing trick!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|A great day to fight!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|May I jump in?
wavs/audio_0010.wav|No loose threads!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Alright, my turn!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Ready as I'll ever be!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Marvelous!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Whatever it takes!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I needn't hold back.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|This'll cheer me up!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Most terrific!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|What a delight!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|How fun!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|With pleasure!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I run with scissors!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|A few quick cuts!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Icanfight...! I must...
wavs/audio_0024.wav|No!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Just... a few more breaths...
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Not yet! I promised...
wavs/audio_0027.wav|With haste!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I'm gone!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Promptly!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Quick quick!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Akshan, you've made the sentinels proud. Don't let them down.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Irelia, you saved the land. It's an honor to cross blades.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Lucian, quite the journey we had. Are you still a good shot?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|You seem happy, Lux, but you know pain too. Why deny it?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|A talking mountain. Now, what shall I say to you when you fall?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Olaf, my friend. Still looking for a glorious death?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|A giant ram who sharpens scissors. Why... dreams do come true!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Riven. A little thread and that blade will be as good as new.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I've missed you, Senna. Let's give our best, for Isolde.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|A stage, a voice, is that really all you are?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Thresh; no matter your formâ€”I've faced you once. I'll do it again.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Sentinel, maybe the world would look better without those dark glasses.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Vex, you can be happy for the right reasons. I'll prove it.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Viego. You never deserved love. Especially not hers.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Yasuo, your clothes are truly terrible.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Please take care of the maiden... or I won't go easy on you.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Just like the good old times. Sweet, simple, and out of control!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Bad jokes are a waste of life!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I know your tricks, Akshan. Do better.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Irelia, that wasn't the hero who saved the land.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Good try, Lucian. I'll tell Senna you 'got me good'.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|No running from pain, Lux. Next time, shine through it.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|You're most welcome, Olaf. I promised you'd die with glory.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Mr. Ornn, are you still there? Are you asleep?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Haha, five in a row! What an absolute joy!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Riven, I fought alongside a stronger you. Show me her.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Please, Senna. Don't hold back. I've seen your strength.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|A pretty voice, Seraphine. What a shame that's all you were.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I suppose you didn't plan for that. How unlike you, Thresh.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Vayne, you're a sentinel! I'd expect more.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Vex, next time give joy a chance.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|She pitied you. I never did.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Oh! The wind feels nice again.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Don't worry, I'll show the maiden how to smile.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|No stitching that back together.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|No time to rest.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I feel so alive!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I won't let you hurt anyone!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Another down, I'm getting good.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Try again! I dare you!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Ha, how foolish!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|She'd be proud.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I did that! Me!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Scissors, needles, thread; tools of Isolde. She'll always be with me, and I with her.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|What a strange, wonderful world. I must make sure it stays that way.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Edward Scissorhands
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Alright everyone. First, we must win. After, I'll be glad to fix any clothes, hair, or broken spirits.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Bits of fabric can become something beautiful. My work here can do just the same!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|I remember when she sewed my dress with these scissors. Now, they cut a different cloth.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Oh, are those mountains beyond the cliffs? I've always wished to see one up close!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|It's called the Hallowed Mist, but how it feels matters more. Warm, safe, like nothing can hurt me.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|This place certainly brings out the fight in everyone. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't present my best.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I've certainly endured far worse than this.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Edward Scissorhands
wavs/audio_0085.wav|The memories I stitch here will be my own.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I've got to make each footprint mean something.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|The wind at my back feels so good. I can't lose this. I won't.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|What happens next, I get to decide!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|The Black Mist won't hurt anyone. I promise.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|They're trying to stop me. Well, they can keep on trying!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|If only she were here to see this... see me.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I will experience everything like I never could before!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The struggle is worth it.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|These turrets look strong, it'll be quite fun cutting them down!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Onward!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|This is better than a dream. It's real, and I won't ever forget it!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Oh, what to do!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|No one said life would be easy. That is its charm, to be sure.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Seeing my dress twirl reminds me to smile.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I'll make sure my allies feel the joy they deserve!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I'll break as many needles as it takes to get this right.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I sense their resolve. No matter, mine will be stronger.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Don't waste a minute!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Isolde. Wherever you are, I know you'll be alright.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I must hurry if I am to win.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Ahh, that brisk, fresh air!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|To shreds!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Cut through!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Snip snip!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Ha, to pieces!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Out of my way!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|She's still with me!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Pin them down!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Needles out!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Go!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Enough!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Off we go, scissors!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I learned this trick back home, and added my own misty touch!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Hold on, I need to grab more supplies! Don't start a fight without me!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Ugh, I can't give up! Not now, not ever!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Oh? I thought I was lost, but I'm still here. I'm still alive!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Ugh, I can do this! For her, and for everyone!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I heard something. 'You are bad!' They said it, not me.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|How sad, you must be broken on the inside.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Hallowed protection.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Safe and sound.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Blessed mist!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Hide and seek.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Head high, chin up, scissors ready!
