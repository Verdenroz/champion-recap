Think carefully, my friend.
Let's show our friends the door.
When going gets tough, you call Braum.
Show me your best.
Sometimes, shield becomes smashing board.
First we fight, then we eat.
Now I give more than harsh talking to!
My shield is my sword.
Keep your spirits high.
Put away your worried face!
Troublemaker toss is best game.
Today we fight each other. Tomorrow, we may fight together.
Now this is fun!
Sometimes battle is unavoidable.
Think carefully, my friend.
Why not enjoy some warm milk instead?
You hit like baby ram! No horns yet!
Take heart.
This has the smell of a faraway land. Perhaps I shall see it one day.
These shoes... they're too tight!
Ha ha! Perfect!
To friends, I am snowfall. To enemies, I am avalanche!
My shield will protect this shield!
A shield for my shield? I like it!
Ooh! Now I need marshmallow.
Fire does the body good.
I've always wanted an on-fire cloak!
Ohoohoo, nice and toasty.
Sight is the key to victory. Also stone.
No sneaking up on Braum this time.
My shield is here for you.
It is easy, see?
I'm having cold flashes.
Good shot! You'll get them next time.
Look! Your axes bounce right off!
Ah! A refreshing sea breeze!
Hm. It is windy today.
You remind me of Agatha. Best cow back home.
Alistar! I have cow you should meet.
Mother gave me bear as child too, Annie.
Somethingfishyhere? Hehehehehe!
What's your poison, Gragas? Mine's milk!
After this, we share a drink! You like goat's milk?
Tryndamere! This is fun, right?
Are you having fun, my friend?
Your hair... we do not see things like this in the Freljord.
The goats are wise; eat everything, climb everything, and if something kicks you, kick it back!
When life gives you curdled milk, be patient. You get very good cheese!
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
Good times, good friends... what could be better?
Shall we begin?
Let's get going.
Now, what can we learn from fighting?
Ah, new beginnings.
Is it the moustache? Who knows?
Always bring Braum!
Today will be exciting day!
If they insist on a fight, I will oblige them.
They may have many, but you have me.
Follow me, friends!
Ah! We are about to begin the fighting!
Mother always said: 'Don't lose!'
Move like the herd.
Braum is on the job.
No time for worrying.
You can always trust Braum.
Even heaviest door can be opened.
Hehe, life is good, no?
You are safe with Braum.
Nacho Libre
I wonder what's around next corner.
Let us go.
If you have problem, you come to me first.
Strike like ram!
Ah... returning home.
Hehe, time for a snack.
Back I go.
See? That wasn't so bad.
Is very important to take time to rest.
Don't worry, Braum was trying little bit.
If at first you do not succeed, please, tell me what it is like.
Train hard, little poro, and one day you will be strong like... baby!
Eat, eat and grow strong.
You thought you were in trouble.
Stand behind Braum!
Braum is here!
The heart is the strongest muscle.
