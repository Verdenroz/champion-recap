Lillia_Original_Attack_6.wav|lillia|en|I'm going in! For...some reason.
Lillia_Original_Attack_7.wav|lillia|en|Ow! Wait, I hit you?
Lillia_Original_Attack_8.wav|lillia|en|Close your eyes so I can say hello.
Lillia_Original_Attack_9.wav|lillia|en|I knew you could sparkle!

Lillia_Original_Attack_15.wav|lillia|en|Whoopsie-lily!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|lillia|en|Better a sleepy head than a sleepy heart.
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|lillia|en|Some come to the garden lost. Others, to lose themselves. Like you, Ahri.
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounter_2.wav|lillia|en|Ivern! Am I still your favorite sprout? N-not that I have to be!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounter_3.wav|lillia|en|You may have tasted...too much purple.
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounter_4.wav|lillia|en|Neeko, can you teach me why the humans hide what's inside? Or...should I ask your flower?
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounter_5.wav|lillia|en|You've spread like a shadow no one sees–because it's within themselves!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterAhri.wav|lillia|en|Nightmares are desire turned inside out, and upside down, and... Oh, dizzy!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterIvern.wav|lillia|en|Running from problems won't solve them. But it makes me feel safe!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterLulu.wav|lillia|en|When he speaks, I hear your whisper, dream!

Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterYasuo_1.wav|lillia|en|Do you think we've met before, in a dream we've both forgotten? Wouldn't that be wonderful?!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterYone_1.wav|lillia|en|Th-they see us, dream! Scamper!
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterYone_2.wav|lillia|en|Would you...maybe, possibly, perhaps...want to dream with me?
Lillia_Original_FirstEncounterZoe.wav|lillia|en|You, over there! Do you hear me? Not you. Your dream!
Lillia_Original_Joke.wav|lillia|en|Your dream calls to me! I-I hope you don't mind. Oh, you mind, don't you?
Lillia_Original_Kill_0.wav|lillia|en|Oh hello, bird! What little whisps have you—A-a-a-achoo! Oopsie.
Lillia_Original_Kill_1.wav|lillia|en|You dreamed until you ached. Now do something about it.

Lillia_Original_Kill_3.wav|lillia|en|Dreams live on, even after the dreamer.
Lillia_Original_Kill_4.wav|lillia|en|Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?
Lillia_Original_KillHuman.wav|lillia|en|D-don't judge a flower by its bud, you!
Lillia_Original_Move_0.wav|lillia|en|Wake up! Wake up.
Lillia_Original_Move_1.wav|lillia|en|Humans cast a spell every night. Every time they fall asleep.
Lillia_Original_Move_2.wav|lillia|en|The garden is filled with burls. The burls, with nightmares... Mother Tree, I'll remind them how to dream.
Lillia_Original_Move_3.wav|lillia|en|You can do this, Lillia. You are a strong, capable dream fawn. A-and you have a big stick. A-and you hit people with it but don't really mean it! Sorry.
Lillia_Original_Move_4.wav|lillia|en|Where are you, little lost dreams? I'll bring you to your home in the Dreaming Tree.
Lillia_Original_Move_5.wav|lillia|en|I'm glad you're with me, dream.
Lillia_Original_Move_6.wav|lillia|en|In my garden—the garden—there's a tree—the tree.
Lillia_Original_Move_7.wav|lillia|en|Night's falling in my garden. Leaves rustle like sheets! Why is...no one dreaming?
Lillia_Original_Move_8.wav|lillia|en|A little girl, lying on her bed. Be brave, dream. She needs you.
Lillia_Original_Move_9.wav|lillia|en|Do you think day turns red because it sees night watching, o-or is it just me?
Lillia_Original_Move_10.wav|lillia|en|Dreams are funny things. Sometimes they have feathers, sometimes they are wooly, sometimes they lift me up like a bubble!
Lillia_Original_Move_11.wav|lillia|en|Everyone is so loud. They never say what they really mean. Really, really mean.
Lillia_Original_Move_12.wav|lillia|en|Humans think trees stand so tall, but they're lying on the air. You can hear them snore, and they're creaking!
Lillia_Original_Move_13.wav|lillia|en|I want to meet a human...from over here. C-can they see me? Don't let them see me! I'm not ready! Eep!
Lillia_Original_Move_14.wav|lillia|en|Mother Tree used to have so many flowers. I hope you meet her one night, dream.
Lillia_Original_Move_15.wav|lillia|en|I can't stop from hiding, from being alone. But maybe, possibly, dream, someone will be alone with me.
Lillia_Original_Move_16.wav|lillia|en|Okay! Don't trip, don't trip—oops! Okay! Don't trip again, don't trip again—woah!
Lillia_Original_Move_17.wav|lillia|en|Every direction here is straight. Where you leave is always behind you. No wonder the humans are lost.
Lillia_Original_Move_18.wav|lillia|en|My hooves are saying prance, but I-I...oh, too much pressure! Eep!
Lillia_Original_Move_19.wav|lillia|en|Dream, I'll tell you a secret. N-never mind. Someone might hear.
Lillia_Original_Move_20.wav|lillia|en|A leaf rustled! Is it okay if I hug my branch? Hug...
Lillia_Original_Move_21.wav|lillia|en|Don't see me, don't see me, don't see me, don't see me! See me.
Lillia_Original_Move_22.wav|lillia|en|Oh, Mr. Root, you almost tripped me.
Lillia_Original_Move_23.wav|lillia|en|When they say goodnight, do you think they mean it?
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|lillia|en|Every time I hold my branch, I see the tree with my fingers.
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|lillia|en|I'll stay in the forest...until I learn how to use doors.
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|lillia|en|A curly mind twists towards possibilities!
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|lillia|en|I'll just...look around for threats. Fifth time's the charm!
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|lillia|en|I'll face anything...b-but won't look it in the eyes. Eep!
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|lillia|en|A yawn is a smile before sleep.
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|lillia|en|Day dreams, night dreams, mid-morning dreams, dusk dreams!
Lillia_Original_MoveFirst_7.wav|lillia|en|The beauty of the world beckons desires to be real.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|lillia|en|Time to out-trot my awkwardness!
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|lillia|en|How can I tip-toe, when I don't have toes?!
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|lillia|en|Dreams help more than gardens grow.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|lillia|en|When I'm quiet, I hear so many things.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|lillia|en|Quiet things are strong. That's why I'm whispering!
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|lillia|en|The humans forget so much when they awake.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|lillia|en|You'll be safe with me, dream.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|lillia|en|I like talking to you, dream.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_8.wav|lillia|en|Every human has a little sparkle.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_9.wav|lillia|en|Nothing cries louder than loneliness.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_10.wav|lillia|en|Hold my branch with me, dream.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_11.wav|lillia|en|What lies beneath the surface? We lie it down to see.
Lillia_Original_MoveLong_12.wav|lillia|en|I catch dreams so the humans can chase them.
Lillia_Original_PEnd_0.wav|lillia|en|You have to close your eyes to open them. Wh-whoops!
Lillia_Original_PEnd_1.wav|lillia|en|Eep.
Lillia_Original_PEnd_2.wav|lillia|en|I just had the strangest reality.
Lillia_Original_PEnd_3.wav|lillia|en|Oh!
Lillia_Original_PEnd_4.wav|lillia|en|No one saw that, no one saw that!
Lillia_Original_PEnd_5.wav|lillia|en|Well met, human. Well left, dreams.
Lillia_Original_PEnd_6.wav|lillia|en|Was...was that...me?!
Lillia_Original_PMax_0.wav|lillia|en|I'm just going to go hide forever now.
Lillia_Original_PMax_1.wav|lillia|en|Everything's so beautiful when it's real!
Lillia_Original_PMax_2.wav|lillia|en|Look who's blooming now!

Lillia_Original_Respawn_1.wav|lillia|en|Not good. Not good!
Lillia_Original_Respawn_2.wav|lillia|en|Do you think they'll remember me, dream? When they wake up, do they remember themselves?
Lillia_Original_Respawn_3.wav|lillia|en|Now I just have to wait for my confidence to regrow.
