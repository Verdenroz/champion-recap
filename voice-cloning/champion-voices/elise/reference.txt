Weak-willed fools!
Dangling by a thread.
Weak-willed fools!
I have… refined tastes.
The spiderdemands sacrifice.
It will all be over soon.
Oh, no!
I hear a man likes a lady with legs.
Hmm, why so tense? Relax.
I know the true path.
We must all make sacrifices.
I know what lurks in the shadows.
I can show them the way to divinity.
Every web, a masterpiece.
There's nothing to fear.
Pull the strings. Watch them dance.
My true beauty is beneath the skin.
They need… guidance.
Come closer, I don'tbite!
The spider,I. Andyou, the fly.
Only the spider is safe in her web.
Sate my hunger!
Tangled in my web.
Simply delicious.
They'll make quite the mess.
The pain will be fleeting.
Nothing but buzzing flies.
Ha! It's all in the body language.
Ha! Ladies wish they had legs like me.
Skitter along, my pets.
I can feel their fear.
Now I thrive!
Strand by silken strand.
How fast can they run on two legs?
I lurk in every shadow.
Nothing escapes my web.
Patience...
Partake of my poison.
The spider,I. Andyou, the fly.
Surprise! Idobite.
