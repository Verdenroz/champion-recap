wavs/audio_0001.wav|I return to my training.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Speed becomes force.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You hesitate.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Come, test your convictions.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Your skill against mine.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Strike firmly!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|I'll see this through.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Their heartbeats quicken.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Your weakness is revealed!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You dare doubt my resolve?
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I will crush body and spirit.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Act free of doubt.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Your spirit trembles.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Fear clouds your mind.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Worry not.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|You upset my balance.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|A flaw in your technique.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I do not teach, I demonstrate.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Break beneath my fists!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|A risk I shall take!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Beware the dragon spirit!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Tong!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Tong!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Tong!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Tong!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I… was not… worthy…
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Dragon spirit… I've failed you.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|My final lesson…
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You are but a gilded reflection of what dragons truly are.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Even in the bitter cold, your spirit burns. How admirable.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Before, we were one spirit. What have we become?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|You won a great victory, Irelia. I look forward to besting you in combat.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Kayn, you bear powers you cannot hope to master. Stop, before it is too late.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Draw your blade, Master Yi. I have waited long to face you.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I am the fire of Shojin. Face me with all your strength.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Shyvana, your spirit seems divided… and familiar.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Old friend, I sense the spirits fighting within you still.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Wukong, someone of your skill ought to listen to his master.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Xin Zhao, or would you rather fight under yourother name?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You say death is like the wind. Shall we see which way it blows?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I fail to see the humor in that.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Our foes are not much to look at.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Blindness is no impairment against a smelly enemy.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Enough blind jokes! Stop asking for more.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Expand too far, and you lose your center.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Your technique reminds me of your home: fierce, but untamed.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|We shared the same home, but not the same beliefs.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|The land will remember you, Irelia.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Kayn, neither path would have given you what you truly desired.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Do not worry,Wujulives on in another.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Send me more Noxians. I have yet to unleash all my power.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Stand up! My training is not yet finished!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Five have fallen before me—let me challenge five more!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Rest, Shyvana.Demaciais not ready to embrace your kind.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Udyr, your rage was beyond your own control.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Wukong, return to your master.  You still have much to learn.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Kings and walls have eroded your form, Xin Zhao.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|The wind has come for you, Yasuo.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Your journey has reached its conclusion.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Mercy is no kindness.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|May your spirit find peace.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|My training granted me this victory.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|That mistake proved your undoing.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I do not give second chances.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You had the confidence, but not the skill.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Hmph. Rethink your approach.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|My sight may be gone. But my vision holds true.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|A fight to the bitter end. I welcome this opportunity.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Many monks live in peace.  I do not envy them.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I will struggle, I will fail, but to surrender is a privilege I do not have.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The weight of this power… it will not hold me back.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|They see only a blind man. I will open their eyes.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I did not blind myself. I called upon the dragon, and suffered its wrath.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|The dragon blazed my trail. I merely walk it.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|The monks taught me well, but I determine my own fate.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|The marks on my body are not warnings; they are reminders of the burden I bear.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|The dragon must be unleashed, or it will consume me from within.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The spirits live among us; their power echoes throughout the land.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Those who do not know their limits will never reach their potential.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Enlightenment is knowing the value of one's ignorance.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|The dragon spirit is not magic; it is life, more ancient than ours.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Ionia prayed for peace. What fools we were to think it possible.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|The dragon answers in flame.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|My training left more scars than any battle.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I will master the dragon's spirit, or die trying.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|My fists are my weapons.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Today will be a worthy test.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I must stay disciplined.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I will atone.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I need no blade to strike down my foes.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I bloodied my knuckles to sharpen my fists.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Endless trials await.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|We do what we must.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|My journey led me here.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Never again will arrogance lead me astray.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Only I can endure the dragon's fury.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Quiet steps.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Find your center.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Extend your senses.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Waste not a minute.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Begone!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Behold!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Hikuh!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The dragon sleeps… for now.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I return to my meditations.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|My spirit rests.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I shall not repeat that mistake.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Failure has not stopped me before.  It will not now.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|The dragon spirit offers me another chance.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|You have not earned victory this day.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Force is meaningless without skill.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Let us see whose spirit is stronger.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Endure!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Keep up!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Stand firm!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Fight on!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Your will, my hands.
