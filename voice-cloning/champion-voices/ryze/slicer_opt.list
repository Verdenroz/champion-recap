Ryze_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|ryze|en|When I've found them all, I'll fade away.
Ryze_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|ryze|en|These runes are not for eyes such as yours.
Ryze_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|ryze|en|No time to talk.
Ryze_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|ryze|en|There it is.

Ryze_Original_Recall_0.wav|ryze|en|Hang on, archmage business.
Ryze_Original_Recall_1.wav|ryze|en|A moment to gather our runes.
Ryze_Original_Recall_2.wav|ryze|en|I'm not running away. I'm running at you the long way around.
Ryze_Original_Recall_3.wav|ryze|en|A pause in the chaos. Let's make it count.
Ryze_Original_Recall_4.wav|ryze|en|Thank the gods, the world's still here.
Ryze_Original_Recall_5.wav|ryze|en|Ugh, being dead wastes precious time!
Ryze_Original_Respawn_0.wav|ryze|en|I still live, but for how much longer?
Ryze_Original_Respawn_1.wav|ryze|en|Let's try again, and this time do it right.
Ryze_Original_Respawn_2.wav|ryze|en|A stupid mistake, one I won't make again.
Ryze_Original_Respawn_3.wav|ryze|en|I thought that guy would never stop talking.
Ryze_Original_Respawn_4.wav|ryze|en|You should read more, expand your vocabulary.
Ryze_Original_ShopClose.wav|ryze|en|So that's what you people do with your spare time.
Ryze_Original_Taunt_0.wav|ryze|en|I'm surprised you can string enough words together for that one. You need a break?
Ryze_Original_Taunt_1.wav|ryze|en|Not going to dignify that with a response.
Ryze_Original_Taunt_2.wav|ryze|en|We'll see how smart your mouth is when the world collapses.
Ryze_Original_Taunt_3.wav|ryze|en|If I had a tattoo that looked like you, I'd get it removed.

Ryze_Original_UseItemWard_3.wav|ryze|en|I'd like to see them try.
Ryze_Original_UseItemWard_4.wav|ryze|en|For whatever lurks behind me.
Ryze_Original_UseItemWard_5.wav|ryze|en|I never liked surprises.
Ryze_Original_UseItemWard_6.wav|ryze|en|If I can see it, I can beat it.
Ryze_Original_UseItemWard_7.wav|ryze|en|Sight makes might.
