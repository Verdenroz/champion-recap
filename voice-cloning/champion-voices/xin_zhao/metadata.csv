wavs/audio_0001.wav|Your hunger dies here, foul thing!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I have silenced louder creatures in darker pits.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Demacia always stood against flame and scale.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Fate made you;Iwill unmake you.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Do not hesitate.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|This ends in silence.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You call that a stance?
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Less flourish, more fighting.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Tighten your guard.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Your life is forfeit!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|You flinched!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Not while I stand.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|For the crown!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|No cheers for you.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Hardly a threat.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Here is a tip—and a spear behind it.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Your form is loud.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Come now, do better.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Demacia… must endure…
wavs/audio_0020.wav|My king… forgive this failure…
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Jarvan… lead them…
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Reckoner to reckoner: you know what comes next.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Another beast that thinks itself immortal.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|It is true then… The boy I knew is dead.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|You have strayed from the righteous path!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Brash. Vain. Unwashed. You must be Draven.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Your name is your oath, Crownguard, andbothare in question.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|My spirit may be rooted in Ionia, but my duty is to Demacia.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You shame your father's crown!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|The storm within you clouds your judgment, Master Kennen.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Your mask becomes you, deceiver.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I once bled for Noxus—today, you will bleed for me.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You remind me of all those reckoners no one remembers.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Return the crown, butcher, or I will carve it from your face!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|It saddens me to see you so far from home, with discord in your heart.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Your temple lies in ruins, Yunara. Do not follow its fate.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I trained a prince. You fight like a squire!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|The crown's justice has found you!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Your footwork says much—none of it good.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Fate rarely gives warnings;thisis yours.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Hup! Hyah! Please inform the king I landed safely.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|We could have stood together. Instead, you fall alone.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Fate brought us here, demon. The spear did the rest.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Scorched, and still I stand.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Nothing left standing.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Cleared in the crown's name.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Your age has passed, darkin. Stay buried.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You are no god, only a disappointment.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I had hoped never to spill Demacian blood again.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Whatever this was, demon, it is done.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Reckoner down. Send up the next.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Hear that? Noxus cheers your fall.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|First to fall!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Demacia did not merely lose a sword. It lost its heart.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|May your spirit choose a more enlightened path.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|One of us lost our way. I hope… it was not me.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|What am I to tell your father, lad? Or our people?
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I was sure you would outlive us all, Master Kennen.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Your schemes die with you, deceiver.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Another death Noxus will not mourn.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I AM BUT ONE DEMACIAN! IMAGINE AN ARMY!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You are no colossus.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|The insult to the throne has been answered… in kind.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Not in my master's kingdom.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Bloodshed averted.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You call that subtle?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Demacia clears the path.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Better the myth than what you became.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Hesitation… that is all it took.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Another falls, the crowd cheers.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Lesson learned… the hard way.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Perhaps you will find strength in the next life.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Stand tall, Demacian, we must defend the shieldless!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|My prince, heed your training. The lance may falter, but you must not.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Your lessons keep me grounded, Master Kennen.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Lady Sona, if I fall today, let your song carry me home.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I stand at your side once more, Yunara.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|'Seneschal' is a title. A duty. The king's sworn protector and most trusted advisor.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|If the people of this world forget what truly matters, I will remind them.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I am the king's spear, driven into the heart of the unjust.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|To protect something greater than yourself—that is why I serveDemacia.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Demacia is a fighter full of promise: gifted and disciplined, but still untested.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I fought in the arenas of Noxus. First to avoid punishment, then because I was good at it.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Why would fate choose a boy from a fishing boat to serve a king? We may never know.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Of the many masters I have served, there is only one I would call friend.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|May I serve as the seneschal of Demacia until my final breath.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Every step carries the weight of two lives: the one I lost and the one I chose.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Demacia's walls are strongest when our gates remain open.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I once thrilled the crowds. Now I serve the king of Demacia.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|A king's gift is never free; this spear came with purpose and cause.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|There is no peace for me… but duty offers a measure of stillness to my spirit.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I would rather die fighting for the shieldless, than live out my days in regret.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Fate offered me a second chance, and I took it.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I carry the weight of the king's trust with each step.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I go where the king commands.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|I would pay a king's ransom for a cup ofIoniantea.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Follow the just path, no matter how narrow.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|My eyes are sharp. Thesilverwingswould agree.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Finally, freedom from all that courtly gossip…!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Nothing soothes old wounds like an Ionian healer.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I am bound by oath, not birth.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Better to move forward than dwell on the past.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|A warrior learns to read the sound of footsteps.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|The royal accounts can wait.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|One sweep of the palace, five new problems.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Demacia is not perfect, but it tries.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Noxustaught me survival—nothing else.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|A warrior moves with purpose.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I fight for the dream of Demacia.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The pits broke everything but my spirit.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|The king's spear obeys.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Flinch and fall!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Strike true!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Staggered!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|FACE THE KING'S SPEAR!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|A thousand battles mean nothing—only the last one matters.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|It is better to walk away upright than crawl back humbled.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|A reckoner rests between bouts. A seneschal returns to serve.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I must confer with the king.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|A brutal reminder that fate has no favorites.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|A lesson to be learned for certain.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|A warrior may fall, but duty persists.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|The 'great Viscero', hmph… Get back out there.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Neither my spear nor my spirit falters.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|You are very confident for someone so unproven.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Make way!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Brace for the lesson!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Right through you!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Clear a path!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|One spear, one thousand battles.
