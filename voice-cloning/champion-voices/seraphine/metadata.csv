wavs/audio_0001.wav|Oookay!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Kick it!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|How about a call and response?
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Let's jam!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|This beat's got a kick!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Sing along!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Listen to yourself!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Pop!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Sing it with me!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Oh, snap!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Catch that rhythm!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Listen!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Oh yeah!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Sometimes music hurts.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Don't back down!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Hear that?
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Do you make carpets? Because you are cutting that rug!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Show's not over...
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Keep singing...!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Not a fan...
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Double time!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|And downbeat!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Feel that reverb!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Pow!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Sit down and listen up!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Love a captive audience!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Azir, lemme try. Shurima!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Camille! Sorry, but you're the only one marching to your drum.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|No one keeps time like you, Ekko.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Such a perfect four-four! But also... so wrong!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Whoa! I can't follow your song at all, and I... love it!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Lux, your song sounds like a rainbow!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Wow! You sing in such color, Neeko!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Oh, Sona, your song is so... wow!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Hey, Vi! Wrote you a fight song. Bet you'd love it.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Wow! We've only just met, and I'm already inspired.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I'll fight if you make me, but we could sing instead!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Aw, how can I say anything bad about a fan? Come on, make some noise!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Can't wait to write a song about this moment!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Hey! Wanna hear your song?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Was that... my first hater?
wavs/audio_0042.wav|One-two-three, one-two-three...
wavs/audio_0043.wav|There's nothing we can't do together!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Your song's gonna get stuck in my head!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Nobody can truly silence you. Not even me.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Thanks for listening!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I expect an encore!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You can't let that be your swan song.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Runnin' out of steam!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I sing to help them find themselves. The stage just makes it easier.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Everything sings to me! I've gotta sing it all back.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|It can't be as simple as us versus them. I know if I sing loud enough, they'll listen!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Wow. All these songs sound amazing. I'll bring them into harmony!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|When I'm on stage, I feel complete. I wanna help everyone find that peace.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Hello, world! I'm Seraphine, and you are beautiful!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Everyone's singing the same song and they don't even know it!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Some songs start with a rhyme, some with a rhythm... Mine, starts with the crowd.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|We fight for our lives every day. Every one of us.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|For the longest time, I couldn't hear myself over the crowd. So, I made them part of me!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Pilties say a new idea is just seven old ones all mixed up. That's kinda how my songs work.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|We get as close to death as we can to feel alive.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|We're all looking for meaning, even after we've found it.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Cities have songs too. Zaun and Piltover sing together in a dazzling duet.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Even if I heard every song, it would never be enough.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Breathe with your belly, breathe with your belly... Gah! Breathing is hard.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Moods are like melodies. They go up, they go down, and sometimes, they surprise!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|One day, the music will stop. Better dance while you can!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I have this feeling like I'm yearning for something I've lost. One day, I'll catch it in a song.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Come for the show, stay for the message.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Music helps you keep your head up.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Lookin' for a song in everything I meet!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Haven't heard a soul that wasn't at least a little raw.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Follow my voice!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Easier to hear someone else than to hear yourself.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Stage fright? Never heard of it.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|You can't keep your song inside.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Everyone's got their own muse. Mine's... everyone!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Everyone fights to be heard. I'll fight to listen.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Not sure where I'm going. Can't wait to find out!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Gotta keep moving with the music!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Folks only love a reflection when it isn't theirs.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Nothing better than a good song!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Maybe the world's not ready for me. I don't mind waiting!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Making it up as I go!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Hear the world in my voice!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Don't mistake me for my lyrics.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Gotta find the rhythm in the chaos.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I wonder what I sound like outside my head.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|People don't always listen, but that's no reason to keep quiet.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Joy's too quiet without sorrow on the downbeat.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Even in my dreams I hear them sing.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|It's harder to stumble on this stage, but it sure does hurt more.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Couldn't lose the rhythm if I tried!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Hope I don't get lost in all this music!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Could use a partner for this next verse!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Careful! Let's play it slow!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Huh. My audience disappeared.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Headin' your way. Get ready to rock!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Ooh yeah!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Oooh yeah~!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Kisses!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Dazzle 'em!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|This one's for you!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Mwah!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Spotlight's yours!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Whole world hears me now!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Your turn to shine!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|That's the end of this performance. Encore's comin' up!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|You've all been a wonderful audience. Thank you!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Next time, I wanna see all of you on stage!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Could've been worse. Could've, um... forgotten the words.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Tough crowd! Maybe it's time to change my tune.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Ready to sing again!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|All right, Sera, no big deal. Pretend it's a rehearsal.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Hm... Think they wanna hear more? Of course they do!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Gonna write a kicker out of that one.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|My song is yours!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Reference
wavs/audio_0119.wav|You're up!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Feelin' brave!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|The stage is yours!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Harmonize!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Let's change the world!
