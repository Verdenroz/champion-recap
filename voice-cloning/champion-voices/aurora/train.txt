I'd rather be home anyway.
Move! I'm busy.
Deep breaths.
Teach me something new.
Stay back!
Leave me alone!
You're in my personal space.
Interesting choice.
This is field research!
Don't touch me.
I have better things to do!
Let's get this over with!
You're angering the spirits!
Respect my boundaries.
Thanks! I hate it.
Pew!
Phow!
Prrring!
All together now...!
Haestryr... I'm s-... sorry...
I haven't... done enough.
Back to the Spirit Realm...
Through the looking glass!
A door, unlocked!
One realm, to another!
Ysjarn, I've been searching for you. My friend Haestryr, he needs your help.
Ashe, you want to bridge the Freljord's divide. But unity isn't harmony.
I'm something of a witch myself, you know!
You're not human. But... you're not a spirit either. You are however... Very loud.
The pain you carry... I've never seen anything like it.
Nagakabourosis your god, right? I'd love to know more.
Wolf and Lamb... I didn't think I'd meet you so soon!
You are no witch, Lissandra. You're a disease.
Same hat? Same hat.
Well met, Ramhaurg! I have so much to share with you since we last spoke!
This is the culmination of my research. Spirit friend... I can help you!
I recognize those ravens. Are you their owner? Or, do they own you?
We meet again, spirit walker. Care to catch up after this?
I can feel you trying to invade my mind, Valhir. Cut it out...!
You stain your blade with spirits, Yone! Why hurt what you can heal?
A yordle!! I've never seen one in the material realm before!
Aurora gasps.
It seems we're temporary collaborators. I know just the topic to... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
Your chaos!
I've exceeded my capacity for social interaction today...!
My work is at a critical juncture, so this interruption is not ideal.
Oh, you're interested in spirits? I have so much to share! Where do I start...
Ta-da! Hilarious, right?
That had the components of a joke, but... it wasn't funny.
Ysjarn, be reborn. Haestryr and I will find you again.
Ashe, your ideas may be noble, but your execution is lacking.
Thank you, Illaoi. I'll be adding the Serpent Islesto my list.
I'll tell you when I'm ready to go, Kindred.
Lissandra — I'll heal what you've defiled.
Goodbye, little friend.
So strange, yet so cute.
We'll talk later, Ramhaurg!
Ah, finally! Now where was I?
I can still help...! Let me organize my notes, and we can try again.
These turrets are not conducive to my work.
That was... easy. Who constructed this?
See you again soon, spirit walker! I always appreciate our repartee.
Your feral nature doesn't scare me, Valhir.
Killing spirits will never bring you peace, Yone.
Where do yordles go when they die...? Back toBandle City?
Bookmarked for later study.
Enough of that, thank you.
Well, that was a waste of my time.
Back to work.
You'll enjoy being a spirit, it's nice.
Knowledge is power... Try reading a book.
I lost my train of thought.
It's such a relief to have you here, Ramhaurg. Our other colleagues are so... loud.
Ooh, another spirit! Wow, look at you! Oh... you're going that way? Okay, we'll talk later!
Spirit walker; I'm looking forward to working with you again. I'll show you what I've learned.
Unless you know anything about spirits or theSpirit Realm, you'd do well to let me focus on my work.
Do any of you wanna talk about spirits? ...I'll assume that's a yes!
I have my book, my wand, my starting supplies... Do I need anything else? Okay... Let's go!
This region is teeming with wayward spirits. I'll find and help them all.
Just so you all know, I'll be focused on my research. You can expect to receive my notes once I'm done.
Spending time with others is exhausting. If I seem curt, don't take it personally.
The worst fate for aDemi-godis to be forgotten. I won't let that happen to Haestryr.
Okay. Let's go.
I see the Spirit Realm and material realm simultaneously — this blended world is my own... and it's beautiful.
You know, technically, we're never more than five steps from a spirit.
This is far too much walking.
Spirits become wayward by absorbing the pain of mortals. It's my job to cleanse what each wisp has endured.
I want to help Haestryr more than anything, but I'm not strong enough... yet.
The Spirit Realm, the material realm... they aren't mirror images, but two halves of one existence.
So little is documented about the Spirit Realm — my work will help others understand what they can't see!
Once I'm done here, I'm going to celebrate by reviewing everything I've learned. I love paperwork.
We're all just a collection of fragile bones held together by sinew and muscle. At least I'll be a spirit in my next life.
No one is ever truly alone: spirits are all around us!
Fascinating! I'll review this later.
Spirits are so lucky they're not people.
I quite enjoy my own company!
Auntie Havu would like it here. She loves drama.
I go where my research takes me.
How can anyone be afraid of ghosts? They're adorable!
Haestryr, my friend... I'll do all I can to help you.
Weaknesses can also be strengths.
I see, I see... very interesting.
Would anyone notice if I just...left.
Oh! I've read about this!
So few see the world as I do.
The sounds, the smells... I hate it.
The spirits here are different from the ones in the Freljord.
The spiritual balance here is... off.
I woke up early for this...
I should write home. So my... family knows I'm still alive.
I like when it's quiet — I can hear myself think.
Follow me. I'll help you.
Hope you don't mind the detour!
You'll be safe with me.
I appreciate the company.
Let me guide you home.
Hello, little spirit.
P-cha!
Open your mind!
See my world!
With eyes unclouded.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Take it in.
I see your spirit.
My worlds converge!
See between!
You're in my realm now!
Give me a second to decompress.
Anyway. Bye.
This is a lot to process... I'll return after a break in the Spirit Realm.
How does anyone fight for this long... It's exhausting.
I won't let Haestryr be forgotten! There has to be more I can do.
The material realm is such an eye strain... One moment, I need a change of scenery.
Still corporeal... Oh well!
Okay, back to work! The spirits here still need me.
Oh, we're not done? ...We're still fighting? ...Okay.
Note to self: repeating previous actions may lead to unfavorable results.
That was... not ideal; but I won't let this derail me.
Everything is so... expensive.Explain.
No, I am not interested in purchasing any carrots.
Pewww... ding!
Steven Universe
What an 'interesting' thing to say out loud.
Between worlds.
Crossing over.
Beyond the veil.
See with eyes unclouded.
