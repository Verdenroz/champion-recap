Well, now I'm just mad.
Beat up, or beat down? I'm flexible.
Time to introduce myself.
Someone's about to get hurt.
This is going to get messy.
I'm done being nice.
Don't be such a stiff.
Well, now I'm just mad.
Knock it off.
Hey, sorry about the pain.
No need to be mean.
Pick on someone your own size.
Don't push your luck, champ.
These jerks don't know when to quit!
Back off, pal.
Keep it together.
Look what they did.
Not again.
I hate it when this happens.
Whoa!
Woohoo!
Incoming!
Let's bounce!
Put some spring in your step.
There's plenty of me to go around.
How's it goin'?
I may bend, but I don't break.
Just another day on the job.
I could really use a snack right now.
I never skip breakfast.
Fighting is in my blood... I mean... my goo.
Why thanks! I do work out.
Mom always said I was big for my age.
Everybody's a critic.
Squashing time!
Heads up!
It's not how much you can lift. It'show good you look!
Go big... orgo home!
I was made for this... literally.
