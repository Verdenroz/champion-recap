wavs/audio_0001.wav|I'm on to you!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I demand tribute!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Look what the pipes washed in.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Plenty more where that came from! Seriously, I carry a lot of ammo.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I greased these all myself.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I licked this bolt for you.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Ohoho, that's gonna fester.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|How do you aim with all this light?
wavs/audio_0009.wav|They'll have more holes than my favorite cheese.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Exterminatethis!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Shooting's easy. Aiming's hard.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Hope that gets infected.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I dealt it! It was me!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|No touching!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Mine!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Ripe for the picking.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Stand still! My eyes are on the side of my head!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Would you make me a sandwich?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Aim, then shoot. Aim, then shoot.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|It'll only hurt 'til you die.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|My last whisper will be yogurt mold.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|My last whisper will be maggot pie, ooh.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|My last whisper will be street bacon.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|My last whisper will be curdle pops.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|My ears are tingling. My... tail is tingling.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You drink this?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Oof, this'll put hair on your tail.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Needs more... sludge.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Nobody sneaks into my turf.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Trespassers will be shot, then looted, then... chewed on for a while!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I need these for my stash.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Ah, a little stench and it'll be perfect.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Aww, this doesn't smell at all.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|It's mine.Ilicked it.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Shiny, not for long.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Shiny? Ugh.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|This will do.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|You're looking a little green!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Stop moving my stench!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|The only thing the sun's good for, is what it does to milk.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I have this... uncontrollable urge to follow you.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|I see why everyone chases you.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Oohoohoo, Singed! You smell nice!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I thought this place could use a little gooping up!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|You remind me of home.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I'm a connoisseur of the finer things!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Sneaking around really works up your appetite!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Always pack a snack a month in advance!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Ah, finally ripe!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Hey, what did I step in?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|From out of the sewers comes... doom.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|All roads lead to Rome
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Rust is like more delicious mold.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Who's following me?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Hop on, lice.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|They are the plague.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Watch your step.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Have you met my fleas?
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Are you gonna finish that?
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Aged like a fine egg.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Dip it in sewage... leave it in the sun for a while... oh, yes, that's perfect, yes!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Who let all these plants survive?
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Ohoho, yes, yes...
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Spongebob Squarepants
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Don't trust any liquid that you can see through.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|It's sticky so you don't drop it.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Ugh, I can't even taste the air up here, bleugh.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|They're planning something, I know it.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I'm on to you!

wavs/audio_0082.wav|I'm dedicating this piece to you.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|One of these is going to get stuck in your head.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|D'aww, it's not even stale yet!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Bleurgh, this tastes awful!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Trespassers will be gnawed.
