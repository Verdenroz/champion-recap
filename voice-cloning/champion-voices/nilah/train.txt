I don't blame you. I'm quite strong.
Baron Nashor. I wonder which of us is stronger.
A perfect enemy to test my skill!
Beast of ancient legend, face me!
I have slain greater dragons than you.
Give my regards to the viper worms.
Finally, a true monster of the old world.
I've waited a long time to fight a myth like you.
Prepare yourself, Herald of the Rift.
Don't hold back, Void-born. I want this to be fair.
Elation!
Leave your mark on the world!
Water, take shape!
Yes! Claim your joy!
My waters cut deep!
Find your form, water!
Such happiness!
Let us fight as equals.
There's only you and me.
Let the heavens bear witness!
I will not fall to you.
A worthy adversary!
My bliss is battle.
Water, to me!
Joy in all things!
The river swells!
Demon, obey me!
And how strong areyou?
They will write songs about this!
Remember… my name…
The time is now!
Joy has found you!
Advance!
Face me!
Prepare for death!
Here I am!
Close in!
Is this a test, gods? I hope you don't mind losing your Aspect.
Fallen lords of light, now flesh and rage, will you face me?
You are nothing, demon! I've crushedhundredsof your kind.
Lord of Fear, I know what youreallyare and I know how to kill you.
How many times must I embarrass you, Malcolm Graves?
Test me, Illaoi. I know I will prevail.
To think, the brave Kalista ofCamavor, reduced to this…
Your ancestors and mine once shared a homeland, Darha.
Twin faces of death, I test my mettle against the end itself!
I know your name, Sahn-Uzal. You are weak to fear death.
Atreus, is it? Few are worthy to hold power such as ours.
You left Viego on our doorstep, Sentinel. Not very neighborly.
We are not alike, Jericho Swain. I know the price I paid.
Tobias Felix. You're a cheat and a bad friend, and I don't like you.
Viego, we didn't fall to Camavor when you lived and I won't fall now!
You have begun to fade, Thousand-Pierced Bear, but I will give you one last battle.
Prepare yourself, joy will not falter.
I am Nilah of the Seventh Layer. Let us begin.
True happiness lies in the heart of battle! Let us claim it.
Give me five, demon— OWW! What are you doing!? That was way too hard!
You sound nervous. Are you compensating? Do you need a moment?
HA!First of nothing! Tell theother eightwhere to find me.
Conquer the foe before you, no matter how great.
Now you know what you're up against.
That was fast. Should I have held back?
Call me when you need me, Malcolm Graves, but I tire of this.
Strange, I feel a third presence. Something far older.
I am the living joy! Remember my name:Nilah!
The greatest foes are mine alone. Let no one forget.
Hmm… Malcolm Graves deserved better.
Old Camavor's evil ends where it began… with a broken heart.
May you find joy in the world beyond.
Another chapter in the epic of Nilah!
An enemy of skill and worth—I thank you.
I am a power far beyond you, I'm afraid.
When you meet the demon, warn him of my strength.
I slay foes the size of mountains! You were… fine, I guess.
The river of fate drowns the unworthy.
I am unbound from the world, mighty and joyous. May evil tremble before me.
In death,Ashlesh, my spirit is yours. But in life, your strength and joy belong to me.
Ashlesh, Lord of Joy, for stealing my name and my fate, I claim your power.
Bilgewateris nice. There's always something big to kill.
Raging demigods, dragons, the age of the world… *scoffs* Not enough. Who's next?
Joy is not an easy power to master. It infects you, becomes you.
I exist in but a single moment: eternal, unbreaking bliss.
My past is gone, traded for the strength to do good.
Seven hands reach for seven locks, yearning to break free.
I will face the great villains of myth, and live forever in song.
Evil hides in every corner of the world, but I always find it.
They can't remember the woman I was, but will know the hero I am.
The Lord of Joy rages in his prison, his power taken… by me.
I prefer my enemies several stories tall… keeps things fair.
Be water, my friend
Bring me more foes to defeat.
I will topple giants.
There is great power behind this smile… Be wary.
Joy wasmychoice. I would choose it again.
Rage in your prison, demon! I am in control.
No god nor devil can stop me!
All I feel is joy! It is… difficult.
I need only three weapons: water, muscle, mind.
May these battles ink the pages of history.
No adversary is too powerful for me.
Cast away fear and spit in the eye of evil.
Triumph and exaltation.
It isthrillingto face the beasts of old!
For this strength, I gaveeverything.
May we lose ourselves to joy.
Master one evil, then destroy the rest.
The bigger they are, the better the fight.
River of fate, guide me to greatness.
My epic will be long and joyous.
Water binds us, as it binds the demon.
Bliss in life, and bliss for ever after.
Turn darkness against itself.
Embrace joy!
Joy protect you!
Gentle waters.
Cover them!
The river carries you!
Feel bliss!
Delightful.
Joyous!
Flow!
With speed!
Again!
Surge!
Water, strike!
Felicity!
Jubilation!
Cast down he fell, reaching upward with his seven hands.
Ashlesh turned to gaze upon the stars, and his hungers only grew.
He rests now, trapped in the Seventh Layer deep beneath the waters.
Ha! My joy endures!
My legend remains unwritten.
The epic of Nilah does not end here.
Whip
I am Nilah of the Seventh Layer! Accept my challenge!
You speak with great passion, but zero brain. Where have you left your mind?
This ismydomain!
Move like the river!
No foe can match me!
Dance upon the lake!
Water, rise!
Challenge me here!
Joy, unceasing and forever!
