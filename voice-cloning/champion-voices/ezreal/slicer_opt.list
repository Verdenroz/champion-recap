Ezreal_Original_Attack_1.wav|ezreal|en|This belongs in a museum. - So do you. Nazis... I hate these guys...
Ezreal_Original_Attack_2.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, your loss. But I get it.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_3.wav|ezreal|en|The uglier the monster, the more fun they are to shoot.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_4.wav|ezreal|en|Stand back! Let an expert handle this.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_5.wav|ezreal|en|Pick a timestream, kid.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_6.wav|ezreal|en|Hey Garen! How's your sister?
Ezreal_Original_Attack_7.wav|ezreal|en|Heh, this is so us! Right, Lux?
Ezreal_Original_Attack_8.wav|ezreal|en|This is flirty fighting.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_9.wav|ezreal|en|Aim for the legs...
Ezreal_Original_Attack_10.wav|ezreal|en|I'm gonna send you back to... wherever Yordles come from.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_11.wav|ezreal|en|Leave Lux alone, Zoe!
Ezreal_Original_Attack_12.wav|ezreal|en|I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_13.wav|ezreal|en|Tell me the odds, I dare you!
Ezreal_Original_Attack_14.wav|ezreal|en|No time to waste!
Ezreal_Original_Attack_15.wav|ezreal|en|Another day, another bullseye.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_16.wav|ezreal|en|I'll handle this!
Ezreal_Original_Attack_17.wav|ezreal|en|Time for a true display of skill.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_18.wav|ezreal|en|All part of the adventure.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_19.wav|ezreal|en|No sweat.
Ezreal_Original_Attack_20.wav|ezreal|en|Watch and learn!
Ezreal_Original_AttackBaron.wav|ezreal|en|Obstacle, meet gauntlet.
Ezreal_Original_AttackDragon.wav|ezreal|en|Hard work? Not today!
Ezreal_Original_AttackEkko.wav|ezreal|en|I'm a professional.
Ezreal_Original_AttackGaren.wav|ezreal|en|I'll make this look easy.
Ezreal_Original_AttackLux_0.wav|ezreal|en|Hah! I can blink and still not miss.
Ezreal_Original_AttackLux_1.wav|ezreal|en|You're between me and glory.
Ezreal_Original_AttackShyvana.wav|ezreal|en|Haha, I'm allergic to caution.
Ezreal_Original_AttackYordle.wav|ezreal|en|Magic? Comin' at you.
Ezreal_Original_AttackZoe.wav|ezreal|en|Oh-ho! It is so on.
Ezreal_Original_BuyItem_0.wav|ezreal|en|No problems here!
Ezreal_Original_BuyItem_1.wav|ezreal|en|Gauntlet, let's clear a path.
Ezreal_Original_BuyItem_2.wav|ezreal|en|This is really worth ten times the asking price.
Ezreal_Original_Dance_0.wav|ezreal|en|Can I get an itemized receipt? My accountant's way too good at his job.
Ezreal_Original_Dance_1.wav|ezreal|en|Nice. You can send the bill to my uncle's museum.
Ezreal_Original_E_4.wav|ezreal|en|Are you not intrigued?
Ezreal_Original_E_5.wav|ezreal|en|Lot of good mages out there! None of them are this hot!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|ezreal|en|Over here!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|ezreal|en|Now I'm here!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterAnnie.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, a little girl! There's gotta be a twist. *gasps* It's the teddy bear, isn't it?!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterAscended.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, cool. Great. They have an Ascended. This should be fun.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterAshe.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, Ashe. I totally meant to return that Avarosan sculpture thingy. Is that an ice bow? That's a cool ice bow.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterAurelionSol.wav|ezreal|en|A celestial dragon that throws stars. Well, this is totally normal. I can do this.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterBilgewater.wav|ezreal|en|Everyone! Watch your coin purses!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterCaitlyn.wav|ezreal|en|Possession is 9/10ths of the law, Caitlyn. Those pre-Zaunite demon totems are mine fair and square.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterCamille.wav|ezreal|en|Okay, Camille. Fork over thatBrackernCrystal.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterCorki.wav|ezreal|en|Woo! Strong goggles game, Corki. Keep it up.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterDarkin.wav|ezreal|en|Darkin? We're gonna need a bigger army!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterDemacia_0.wav|ezreal|en|Jarro Lightfeather doesn't do autographs. Sorry.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterDemacia_1.wav|ezreal|en|Listen, I have met exactly one Demacian I've liked. By the way, has Lux mentioned me at all? Just curious.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterDemigod_0.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, okay, demigods! Well, universe, you seem to really want to screw with old Ezreal today!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterDemigod_1.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, please, we gotta deal withdemigods?!I really need to up my rate.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterDemon.wav|ezreal|en|Demons? This is a job for Jarro Lightfeather.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterEzreal.wav|ezreal|en|Aw, crap, I opened a mirror dimension again! ...Does my hair really look like that?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterGalio.wav|ezreal|en|Giantpetricitegargoyle. So it's gonna be one of those kind of days.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterHeimerdinger.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, brainface, you are why no one likes Yordle inventors.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterJayce.wav|ezreal|en|Can't manufacture magic in a lab, Jayce! Or good looks, for that matter.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterJhin.wav|ezreal|en|That mask is not art, Jhin. It's ancient history.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterJinx.wav|ezreal|en|Nope! I did not sign up for Jinx-level crazy.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterKindred.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, Lamb... is Wolf friendly?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterLeBlanc.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, I've heard of theBlack Rose. Nasty reputation... I mean, uh, huge fan!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterLucian.wav|ezreal|en|Lucian! It's me... Jarro Lightfeather.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterLux_0.wav|ezreal|en|I'm a mage. You're a mage. I'm blond. You're blonde. Doesn't it feel like we're made for each other?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterLux_1.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, Lux! *clears throat* Hey, Lux. What're yah up to later? Let's hang.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterLux_2.wav|ezreal|en|Don't pretend you didn't see me, Lux. That doesn't work.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterLux_3.wav|ezreal|en|Hi, honey! Is it too soon to call you honey? It's too soon.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterNoxus_0.wav|ezreal|en|Why is it always about strength with Noxians? How about vulnerability for once?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterNoxus_1.wav|ezreal|en|Can you forge me a matching gauntlet?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterOrnn.wav|ezreal|en|Heh! Piltovans! Always think they're the center of the universe.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterPiltover.wav|ezreal|en|Well, you are just terrifying, aren't you, Pyke?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterPyke.wav|ezreal|en|So... Rakan. How serious are you and Xayah? Just asking.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterRakan.wav|ezreal|en|What the heck is that?!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterRekSai.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, Ryze! Are you still hiding all those dangerous runes in one place? (louder) Should I not yell that?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterRyze.wav|ezreal|en|Shadow Isles... all that Black Mist has got to be protecting something really valuable.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterShadowIsles.wav|ezreal|en|Shurimans. Always thinking I appropriated their cultural heritage. They're not wrong.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterShurima.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, c'mon! Sivir! I swear, I didn't know I was robbing your family's ossuary!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterSivir.wav|ezreal|en|Throw some more rocks, Taliyah! I need targets to shoot!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterTaliyah.wav|ezreal|en|Targonians... Hey, ten words or less, what exactly are you guys?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterTargon.wav|ezreal|en|Yeah, I get it. It's tough being handsome. Right, Taric?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterTaric.wav|ezreal|en|Didn't expect unliving ghouls. Note to self: always expect unliving ghouls.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterUndead.wav|ezreal|en|Vastaya! Just like inSantangelo's field guide!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterVastaya.wav|ezreal|en|Well hello, Xayah. You should know that I am pro-Vastayan rights.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterXayah.wav|ezreal|en|Hey, Xerath! How come you didn't get a cool Ascended animal body?
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterXerath.wav|ezreal|en|Gahh, I'm too young for you, Zoe. Cradle-robber.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterYordle.wav|ezreal|en|Zoe, you're ruining my chances with Lux!
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterZoe_0.wav|ezreal|en|Time to show 'em who's best. Spoiler: it's me.
Ezreal_Original_FirstEncounterZoe_1.wav|ezreal|en|Don't make me put my goggles on. They're decorative.
Ezreal_Original_Idle_0.wav|ezreal|en|Hey there, gauntlet!  How ya doin', buddy?
Ezreal_Original_Idle_1.wav|ezreal|en|Do I wear my gauntlet... or does my gauntlet wear me?
Ezreal_Original_Joke.wav|ezreal|en|Ah. Watch this...  We will never speak of this again. Ever.
Ezreal_Original_JokeResponse_0.wav|ezreal|en|There's somewhere else I gotta be. Literally anywhere else.
Ezreal_Original_JokeResponse_1.wav|ezreal|en|This is no time for jokes. Your jokes. My jokes are great.
Ezreal_Original_Kill_0.wav|ezreal|en|Never act like victory is assured. Even though it probably is.
Ezreal_Original_Kill_1.wav|ezreal|en|No applause, please! ...Okay, maybe just a bit of thunderous acclaim! ...A little?
Ezreal_Original_Kill_2.wav|ezreal|en|That escalated quickly.
Ezreal_Original_KillBaron.wav|ezreal|en|Good job, everyone. Let's, uh... just keep doing whatever you were doing.
Ezreal_Original_KillPenta_0.wav|ezreal|en|Cool guys never look back at explosions.
Ezreal_Original_KillPenta_1.wav|ezreal|en|Oooh, I hope that wasn't a world heritage site.
Ezreal_Original_KillPenta_2.wav|ezreal|en|I'll come back later and sift through the rubble for artifacts.
Ezreal_Original_KillTurret_0.wav|ezreal|en|Everyone see that? No? Damn! Now I've got to go and do it again!
Ezreal_Original_KillTurret_1.wav|ezreal|en|They just don't make temple traps like they used to.
Ezreal_Original_KillTurret_2.wav|ezreal|en|Name's Ezreal. E-Z-... oh, you're dead.
Ezreal_Original_KillTurret_3.wav|ezreal|en|And Ezreal is victorious!Ahhh! Yeah!
Ezreal_Original_KillTurret_4.wav|ezreal|en|Take five, everyone. I got this.
Ezreal_Original_Move_0.wav|ezreal|en|I don't care where here is. Just point me toward adventure.
Ezreal_Original_Move_1.wav|ezreal|en|Yeah, yeah, yeah. World. Peril. Save it. I got it, I got it.
Ezreal_Original_Move_2.wav|ezreal|en|Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere...
Ezreal_Original_Move_3.wav|ezreal|en|Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory... girls are watching.
Ezreal_Original_Move_4.wav|ezreal|en|Stick with me and you'll be fine. That's not a guarantee, by the way.
Ezreal_Original_Move_5.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, please don't die. I can't lose a sidekick. Not again.
Ezreal_Original_Move_6.wav|ezreal|en|Hey. We can do this! Well, I can do this. You, 50/50.
Ezreal_Original_Move_7.wav|ezreal|en|This reminds me of discovering the spirit tomb of Ekrin.
Ezreal_Original_Move_8.wav|ezreal|en|I always know a shortcut.
Ezreal_Original_Move_9.wav|ezreal|en|A beaten path is a boring path.
Ezreal_Original_Move_10.wav|ezreal|en|No way to predict the twists and turns ahead. That's why I wing it!
Ezreal_Original_Move_11.wav|ezreal|en|Never met a problem I couldn't blast away with magic... that I don't even understand.
Ezreal_Original_Move_12.wav|ezreal|en|I use a fake name in Demacia: Jarro Lightfeather.Sentinel of Light, 8th Order. He's a national hero.
Ezreal_Original_Move_13.wav|ezreal|en|They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice.
Ezreal_Original_Move_14.wav|ezreal|en|I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet.
Ezreal_Original_Move_15.wav|ezreal|en|It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do... *cough* not have a college degree.
Ezreal_Original_Move_16.wav|ezreal|en|Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great.
Ezreal_Original_Move_17.wav|ezreal|en|I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? ...Don't answer that.
Ezreal_Original_Move_18.wav|ezreal|en|Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it.
Ezreal_Original_Move_19.wav|ezreal|en|I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself.
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|ezreal|en|Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was... not pretty.
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|ezreal|en|Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something's impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it.
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|ezreal|en|Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a... jackal head, end of times... the usual. I just wanted this ruby scarab. It looked great on my mantle.
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|ezreal|en|Ugh... water's cold. AHH! Something touched my foot!
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|ezreal|en|...And my boots are not waterproof. Fantastic.
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|ezreal|en|I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good.
Ezreal_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|ezreal|en|I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it.
Ezreal_Original_MoveJungle_0.wav|ezreal|en|There's an unspoken law in archaeology: finders keepers.
Ezreal_Original_MoveJungle_1.wav|ezreal|en|Sounds dangerous. I'm in.
Ezreal_Original_MoveJungle_2.wav|ezreal|en|True explorers follow the compass in their heart.
Ezreal_Original_MoveJungle_3.wav|ezreal|en|I'm always open to new ideas. My new ideas.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|ezreal|en|If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|ezreal|en|I. Never. Miss. But I have been known to fire a warning shot or two...
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|ezreal|en|I hate the word 'steal.' I prefer 'liberate' or 'procure.'
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|ezreal|en|Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|ezreal|en|Exploration runs in my family. It's in my blood.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|ezreal|en|No plan survives first contact with me.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|ezreal|en|Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|ezreal|en|Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_8.wav|ezreal|en|Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_9.wav|ezreal|en|Once it's a ruin, I can legally loot it.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_10.wav|ezreal|en|I'm at my best when the world's on the brink of annihilation.
Ezreal_Original_MoveLong_11.wav|ezreal|en|Who needs a map?
Ezreal_Original_MoveRiver_0.wav|ezreal|en|The gauntlet's for show... the talent's all me.
Ezreal_Original_MoveRiver_1.wav|ezreal|en|Heha!
Ezreal_Original_MoveRiver_2.wav|ezreal|en|Ha!
Ezreal_Original_Q_2.wav|ezreal|en|Gawk atthis!
Ezreal_Original_Q_3.wav|ezreal|en|Marvel atthat!
Ezreal_Original_Q_4.wav|ezreal|en|Blast 'em, gauntlet!
Ezreal_Original_Q_5.wav|ezreal|en|Maybe next time I'll open an eye.
Ezreal_Original_Q_6.wav|ezreal|en|That's what skill feels like. Hurts, doesn't it?
Ezreal_Original_Q_hit_0.wav|ezreal|en|Oooh, that looked like it hurt.
Ezreal_Original_Q_hit_1.wav|ezreal|en|Nice shot, me. High-five.
Ezreal_Original_Q_hit_2.wav|ezreal|en|Can't learn that in a textbook.
Ezreal_Original_Q_hit_3.wav|ezreal|en|That was a, uh... that was a warning shot!
Ezreal_Original_Q_hit_4.wav|ezreal|en|I blame the terrain. Totally that rock's fault.
Ezreal_Original_Q_miss_0.wav|ezreal|en|Must've ricocheted off a cricket or... something...
Ezreal_Original_Q_miss_1.wav|ezreal|en|It wasn't a miss. It was a... near-hit.
Ezreal_Original_Q_miss_2.wav|ezreal|en|Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
Ezreal_Original_Q_miss_3.wav|ezreal|en|We mages call this a warlock exit.
Ezreal_Original_Q_miss_4.wav|ezreal|en|Ancient. Magic. Words.
Ezreal_Original_Recall_0.wav|ezreal|en|Relax. I blindly teleport long distances all the time!
Ezreal_Original_Recall_1.wav|ezreal|en|Alright, guys. Don't miss me too much.
Ezreal_Original_Recall_2.wav|ezreal|en|Whoa. Time out, everyone! Don't continue the fight without me!
Ezreal_Original_Recall_3.wav|ezreal|en|Don't attempt anything glorious in my absence.
Ezreal_Original_Recall_4.wav|ezreal|en|Back from the dead? That confirms it. I am a god.
Ezreal_Original_Recall_5.wav|ezreal|en|Megamind.
Ezreal_Original_Respawn_0.wav|ezreal|en|I'll be omitting that little mishap from the expedition logs.
Ezreal_Original_Respawn_1.wav|ezreal|en|I truly hope nobody saw that.
Ezreal_Original_Respawn_2.wav|ezreal|en|If anyone asks, I didn't see any of these priceless artifacts for sale.
Ezreal_Original_Respawn_3.wav|ezreal|en|This belongs in a museum. - So do you. Nazis... I hate these guys...
Ezreal_Original_ShopOpen_0.wav|ezreal|en|Don't worry, I'm not the magic artifact police. Wait, are you?
Ezreal_Original_ShopOpen_1.wav|ezreal|en|Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What are your weak spots again?
Ezreal_Original_ShopOpen_2.wav|ezreal|en|Sick burn... probably? Wasn't listening.
Ezreal_Original_Taunt_0.wav|ezreal|en|Call me when the stakes are higher.
Ezreal_Original_Taunt_1.wav|ezreal|en|Yeah!
Ezreal_Original_TauntResponse_0.wav|ezreal|en|Quest accepted! ...Wait, where are we going?
