Only prey flee.
Baron Nashor; the honor is mine.
Dragons, even here? The hunt never dulls.
Whatever you herald, I will end it before it begins.
You are done!
For Nazumah!
This ismyfight!
Underestimate nothing.
Show me who you are.
You won't last.
What do you fight for?
Yield or die!
To the bitter end!
Perish.
Clash with me!
Fall before me!
Be worthy.
Come and get it!
Hesitation is defeat.
Try me.
Until my last breath.
Do your worst.
I fear no one.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
Nazumah... Must stand...
K'Sante groans.
K'Sante groans.
K'Sante huffs.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante huffs.
Must I do everything?!
K'Sante grunts.
Together.
Stand strong.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante huffs.
Hurry!
K'Sante shouts in effort.
Quickly!
K'Sante grunts.
What are you hiding from, Akshan? Fate, or fear?
Others may call you a god. To me, you're just another beast!
Azir! You think you were born to rule me, but I was born to live free!
When auntie said 'strong women are like steel', she was right!
You think empire means strength, Darius? Grow up, boy.
The worst monsters were once human.
Garen. All privilege, no eyes.
Hey there, little furry cave thing. Are you lost?
No, no-no-no-no! Keep those scissors away from my clothes.
Don't hold back, Jax. Let me learn, from the best.
'A brighter tomorrow', Jayce? For all, or for those like you?
Great beast, you kill to survive; so must I.
Nasus! You watched your kindkillmy people. Never again!
Nilah, you slay monsters—impress me, and we team up.
A grumpy old goat? People will follow any 'gods' these days.
The man who made gods bleed. Show me, Atreus.
You are baccai, are you not...? 'Ok'? Is that it?!
Renekton, your carnage ends now!
You'll make no trophy out of me, Kiilash.
I see you don't lack confidence, Sett. A shirt, maybe?
Sivir, don't let your bloodline determine who you are!
Hello, colonizer! How do you wish to die today?
You weave the land's gift, Taliyah. Cherish it.
The Void, is it? All monsters can be slain.
The lives lost, the baccai—all victims of your pride, Xerath.
Good weapons have many uses!
I'll give you a laugh... So few ever do!
There's your comeuppance.
Ascended no more.
No 'chicken' should play emperor.
Jax! Don't use age as an excuse.
I went all out. You did not.
All those books, Nasus... For what?!
And now, Atreus, return to your hearth.
Formis temporary,classis permanent
God-warrior Renekton, butchered by a man.
Gold can't buy everything, Sivir.
Nothing justifies massacre, Xerath. Nothing!
It wasn't close.
Good! Who's next?
No challenge.
When one hunt ends, another begins.
We're finished here.
All bark. No bite.
K'Sante laughs.
Some of us won't see the end. Remember the fallen, as you draw the enemy's blood.
Hehe, we don't have to be friends. But wedohave to fight, together.
As much as I wish, a single head can't hold counsel. So please, march with me.
K'Sante. Hear my name, and know my strength.
Keep your heads high—we are worthy!
My ancestors built Nazumah. No god, king, or beast could conquer them; andnonewill conquer me.
I'm grateful for the love we shared, but I'm thankful to walk my own path.
We were friends, then lovers, then a path... Some hunts fail; some love stories, too.
In life and in battle, I remember my mistakes. They are my history; my motivation.
If Tope were here, he'd point out all my mistakes. Good thing we separated—because he'd be right!
Even now, my people stand with me. My weapons aimed in their name.
Mother would love this, eh? Her only son, fighting to the death!
Heroes are born from crisis.
Haha, see the way they scramble like baby armadillos!
Shift like the sand. Strike like the eagle.
Roarwith every step.
Here, I make my truth.
I will push them back. Alone, if I must.
Every scar, a lesson.
"Survival is just the beginning!
The desert was my mentor.
Hehe, it wouldn't be worth it if it were easy!
Open battle honors the hunt.
Act like failure is impossible.
Anyone can wield a weapon! Warriors make their own.
Iam the vanguard.
If the enemy asks—I am the answer.
Those who don't respect me will learn today.
'Surrender' is a weakling's word.
Predators become prey, as quickly as night becomes day.
Ascended, warlords, monsters, they are not so different.
Good is not enough.
No monster greater than pride.

Break!
Nowit ends!
K'Sante shouts in great effort.
I'mdoneholding back!
K'Sante shouts in great effort.
You are finished!
I will not yield!
A sound I know well.
The hunt beckons.
It calls. I go.
Remember the cobra-lion. I didn't give up then. Iwon'tnow.
Those who wish me dead... Keep wishing!
I am not dead. Not yet.
Like my ntofos—break me, and I return stronger!
Why didn't they– No matter; so long as I am here, we can win!
Not a chance I lose to the likes of you.
Big egos fall the hardest.
Move!
Get out.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
Back up!
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
K'Sante grunts.
Survive!
Prevail!
Better to fight, than to live in fear.
