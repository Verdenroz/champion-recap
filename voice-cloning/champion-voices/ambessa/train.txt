The Medardas do not forgive, or forget.
Wrath is necessary to defeat our enemies, Mel.
Maybe there is more to your magic, Mel.
Still need your mother to help you finish the job.
You take after your father more than you know, child.
I've fell mightier foes than you, Baron!
An Elder dragon! YOUR POWER WILL HASTEN MY CONQUEST!
Your hide will become my plate mail, dragon!
I will SQUASH you, bug!
Pain: the best teacher!
Amuse me!
Ancestors: Hear out thunder!
Hubris ends in death.
My steel never dulls.
Fall in line!
You are nothing!
You, challenge me?
Kneel before me!
How precious.
Disobedient child!
Embrace your demise!
Respect the Medardas!
Fight with dignity.
Look me in the eye!
Abysmal.
Die with honor!
Pathetic pup!
Such mediocrity!
I go… to my ancestors…
The Medardas… live on…
Mel… I…
With precision!
You're in my range!
My drakehound's bite's DEEP!
I could use a massage. Tell me… Are you good with your hands?
Kiramman. You think it wise to bite the hand that feeds you?
The hand of Noxus… Hope you're not too attached to that title.
Ughhh… Draven.
'The man of progress'? You stood on the shoulders of giants to build your legacy.
'Progress' aged you terribly, boy.
Jinx. My daughter wouldn't bring you to heel, so I will.
Sending my daughter after me, you wretched witch. Too afraid to get your own hands dirty?
Show me all that you have learned, Mel.
So, you have embraced the Wolf? Have you finally realized your potential, Mel?
The exile. You betrayed your nation for a useless cause. Pathetic.
The Desert Rose! As wild as they say. I look forward to this.
Jericho Swain: a raven will never kill a wolf.
Your absence provided a vacuum I was able to fill, Vi. Let me show you my gratitude.
You think yourself a god, Viktor. Let's see if you still bleed.
I will give you purpose, beast… as my weapon of war!
Requesting my audience? How bold! Others have lost their head for less.
A pity you will not live long enough to regret this!
Mortal Kombat X
Look at you: such wasted potential.
You think yourself my equal? HAAA, HA-HA-HAA!!!
I didn't realize I'd get to sample the local fare so soon!
Quit acting the fool!
I made you who you are, Kiramman. And I can unmake you just as easily.
Might doesn't solve every problem, boy.
Your brother must be ashamed he's related to such… filth.
War begins with the first drop of blood!
What did my daughter see in you, Jayce? I taught her better.
You outlived your use, Jinx.
Even a child could see through your illusions.
Ever the Fox, little girl—sly, but soft.
Watch and learn, Mel.
Remember your studies, Mel.
Be proud, Noxian: there is no greater honor than to face death without fear.
THE WORLD KNEELS TO THE MEDARDAS!
For a life of struggle and sublimation, consider your death… a gift.
Another dead traitor. If only you'd made something of yourself, Riven.
A rose may have thorns; but a wolf, has fangs.
All vision, no foresight.
Don't worry, Vi;your city is in much better hands now!
Men. They all think themselves gods.
You would've better served as my beast of war.
Never speak ill of my family.
The frail have no business in battle!
Hah. A waste of my energy.
All is fair in love, and war.
Vision, might, even guille — you lacked all of them.
The choice is simple: yield, or be cut down.
You should've pledged your loyalty… tome.
Your arrogance was your undoing.
You've changed, Mel. Perhaps now you won't disappoint me.
Mel… I always knew this day would come.
Noxus prizes strength above all else. But sacrifice, is the mark of a true warrior.
Stand and fight! Medardas do not suffer the useless.
As your General, all of your mistakes reflect on my leadership. You would be wise to remember that.
I demand absolute loyalty from my soldiers. Do not test me.
Most of you will die; an easy sacrifice.
Coach Carter
Tunnels in your eyes. Lava in your veins. Shadows in your heart.
I did not truly know love, until I held Kino in my arms for the first time.
Like the fox, we watch, Listen… And like the wolf, we strike at first opportunity!
The shadow beneath my daughter grows longer. By securing power, I can protect her.
Strength deepens with sacrifice; and I have given everything.
House of Cards
All will be crushed by the full might of the Medardas!
Kino strayed too far… Slipped through my fingers like sand. I will not lose my daughter to the same fate.
Distractions create wounds that never close! But my children are worth every scar.
Weaknesses can be exploited.I turn mine into strengths!
I would set the world ablaze to protect my family.
I am unrivaled.
I take what I am owed.
My place in this world: I have earned it, bled for it.
I will live to see tomorrow.
A warrior. A mother. There is no difference!
That through cunning, sweat, and steel… We shape our destinies.
The soul is strong, where the heart is weak.
We earn our peace through conquest!
There is no greater motivation… than grief.
Kino… my son… You were a fool.
I have known death since I was a child. My grandfather made sure of it.
I've fought—and won—countless battles!
Everything is for my family's legacy.
Trust must be earned… but few are ever worthy.
Game of Thrones
Medardas are loyal to our own.
Even pawns have a role to play.
To those who underestimate me: I will prove you wrong!
I will never stumble; never break.
Blood, for blood!
Fall by my hand!
Your execution!
Kneel!
RAGH!
Taste the dirt.
Crush beneath me!
THIS ENDS IN RUIN!
Only fools flee!
Looking for me?
Mmmm… Perhaps there's time to sample the local cuisine…!
A mother's work is never done!
Rest is just fuel for the bloodshed, to follow.
Looks like I need to find my entertainment elsewhere!
Can't leave the children unattended for long!
I will regain control.
Their insolence will be repaid in blood.
Any enemy of mine, is an enemy of my family.
Remain centered—desperation is the doorway to oblivion.
Drakehound's Step Dash SFX
Drakehound's Step Dash SFX
Is there no one worth fighting?!
Someone's a glutton for punishment.
Worthless!
Outclassed!
You have no bite!
A wolf has no mercy.
An instrumental mix of Ambessa's theme plays.
