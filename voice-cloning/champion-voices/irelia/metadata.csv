wavs/audio_0001.wav|Tyrant!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Give them no foothold!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Eyes up!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Oho… you've got lead feet.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Mind your form.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Slice through them!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Invader!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Stay composed.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Step with me.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|It's us or them!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Careful—I hit back.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Always attack at an angle.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|The dance begins.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|We stand or perish!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Wewillresist!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|No appeasement!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You'll rue this day!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Follow my lead.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Our time is now!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Balance be damned; wipe them out!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Push them back!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|There is no retreat!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Never surrender!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Show them no weakness.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Wemustprevail!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|It's all in the footwork.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Still mind, swift movement.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|On your toes!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|No room for error.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|For the fallen!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|We are sharpest where we break!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|The blades fly in sync.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Spirit guide me!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Strike fast, and without misstep!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|And; breathe.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Shall we?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Look, a dance partner!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Care to dance?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|This dance kills despots!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Leave this land!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|A sword with a grip? How quaint.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Doesn't fly, but it cuts nonetheless.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Throw it in with the others, let's see if it flies.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Steals their life, like they stole our land… I like it.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Gives life as it takes it… much like the Spirit.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Such a sordid weapon… but effective.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I don't care who made it, so long as it kills invaders.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|A beast of a blade for beastly foes!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Woe to all who would harm us now!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|The ultimate in homeland protection!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Land, name, and nation. Long may they live!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Give all and the Spirit gives back!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Now, watch the bastards fall!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|The blades are honed; let us test their edges.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|(Gasp) Zelos…
wavs/audio_0056.wav|(Gasp) Spirit… (whispering) Why…
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Fight… on….
wavs/audio_0058.wav|(Gasp) O-ma?…
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Stop your flirting Nine-Tails, it's time to take up arms!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I admire your spirit. Your attitude, not so much.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|In Ionia we have over two hundred species of talking dragon! Sorry, not impressed.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Ugh. Your songs are impossible to dance to.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|We don't need legends to save us. We do ourownfighting.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Nice technique. I miss your old hair though. Why'd you change it?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|IONIAAAAA!Hmm, that's me, if I was you.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Eugh, your twirling technique is atrocious.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You dance to your own rhythm; but the land is beating the drums of war.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Where did you go wrong? Is there anything redeemable in you…? It's time to find out.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Somewhere, a forest is missing its idiot.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I'm about to cut your wind! …Wait, n-not like that, I meant my blades are going to… (sigh) Never mind.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Your 'peace' leads to nothing but extermination!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|You claim to speak for the Spirit… as if it doesn't move my blades.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Keep your 'balance', ours is the only side that matters.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Soon, they will grieve inyourvillage.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Your dances are good, but they lack acertain… soul.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|You want redemption? Join me, and kill your masters!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|You know what it's like to lose everything. So you know why I must fight.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Lobbing poison from your ship doesn't make you a genius. It makes you a coward!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Really… Flying blades? Get yourownthing, sister!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Make yourself useful! Return your crystals to the earth.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Were you the one who brought the ravens?  Because I think they just got caught in my blades!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|For a 'brilliant tactician' yousurepick unwinnable fights!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Did you wannalose the other onetoo?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Humans. Vastayans. We are all Ionians, facing a common threat!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Once an Ionian, always an Ionian. You'll never be one of them.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Contrary to what you've heard, I have agreatsense of humor.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|(Clears throat) Wai-wai- uh, wait…
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Wait, wait, wait, wait, no… (clears throat)
wavs/audio_0089.wav|(Grunt of anger) Hang on…!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Wait, wait, wait, wait…
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Killing you won't bring them back… But it still felt good.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|That's for my O-ma.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Bury them in Noxus! This ground will not have them.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Grace bends, where strength breaks.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|One less tyrant.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Do try to keep pace.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Perfection of form.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I dance on your grave.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|And… back to center.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|It's always the blade you don't see coming.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|They made their choice.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Okay! I'm warmed up.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|(Chuckle) A fool forgets to watch his flank.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Always mind your footing.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|A successful ambush!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|(Chuckle) …Hope they learned their lesson.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Leave them. As a warning to others!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Wewilllive on… Either in victory, or in the scars we leave on them!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Let them come! This land will be their graveyard!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|They await my words… What should I tell them…?
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I have but one life to give for Ionia. Imustmake it count.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|We stand on the bones of the ones who came before us. For them,we fight!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|You do not know burden until you've seen a thousand people hanging on your every word.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I did not light my O-ma's lantern. I don't want her to see this slaughter.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Father, mother, Zelos, O-ma, Ohn, Kye, little Ruu… None of them ever had a chance.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Givetheman inch, they'lltake a kingdom.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|A single pebble may sink a warship… And athousandpebbles… (laughs quietly)
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Better times there were, and will be again.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Do we want to be safe, or free? The choice is ours.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Remember what's been lost; fight for what hasn't been.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Zelos told the worst jokes… How I miss them.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Be the leader they need.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|If they capture me they'll kill me… (chuckles quietly)If.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|We are the children of theFirst Lands; and we willnotbe slaves!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|I move to unsung melodies and unbeaten rhythms.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I carry alotmore than these blades.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Ours is the land of magic, andthatis worth dying for.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|They came for our magics. They'll pay with their lives.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|There's a saying: 'Never fight Ionians on their home soil'.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|They didn't kill us all.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Harm no one… Unless they come for your home.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|I never meant to lead. I fought, and they followed.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Each form has a name known only to the wind. At least that's what O-ma said…
wavs/audio_0134.wav|None can do what I do; so I will do it.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Stay ready, and there is no need to get ready.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|A mastered weapon needs no haft.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Dance with what brought you—in this case, blades.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|We are theonlymasters of our fate!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Peace requires two participants.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I am not unfriendly! I am a warm and caring person.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Freedom has a demanding rhythm.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I have walked the silver plains and fished the rivers of grass. The land knows me.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Peace must sometimes be bought with blood.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I've never killed a person… just a lot of Noxians.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Of course I can fight. I grew up with four siblings!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|(Laughs) They thought they could tame our land.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|We do this for those who came before us, and those who come next.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|To live under a boot, is not to live.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|The voices of my brothers still carry on the wind…
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Their weapons are great—but our will is greater.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|They'll know me as the last to lay down her weapons.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Ionia is our only home.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Where they fell, freedom grew.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|An ocean separates us; for good reason.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Ireallyshould've stretched first… Oh well.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I remember when I danced for fun.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Act, and the whole world will move!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|What strange power works through me, I do not know.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Live today like you're going to die tomorrow.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Never stop learning. There's always a form you don't know.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Naruto
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Even if they kill me, they'll still have to fight the land.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|I am both the tranquil sea and the tempest.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|My O-ma always said I had angry feet.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|These blades were whetted on the bones of tyrants.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Yes! Catch them unaware.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Of course. I'll set the trap.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Brilliant. They'll never see it coming.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|I'll draw them in, you take their flank!
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Right, hit them from two sides.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Take out their necks! The heads will follow.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Shall we fight back?
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Remember why we fight!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Hold your ground!
wavs/audio_0175.wav|We do not die this day!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Cast off your shackles!
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Letmetake the lead!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|I do not want your praise. Just your sweat and your blood!
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Dig in!Thisis where we make our stand!
wavs/audio_0180.wav|I will cut a path!
wavs/audio_0181.wav|I will not let them harm you!
wavs/audio_0182.wav|To the last!
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Freedom is yours! Take it!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Press on! We can quit when we're dead!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Keep your form! Move as one!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Stand strong!Nothingcan break us!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|For the bones of our fathers, and the temples of our gods!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Give me your all! I swear it will not be wasted!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Make them remember, so they do not return!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Step.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Two.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Whirl.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Lift!
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Ohn!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Zelos!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Kye!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Ruu!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Go.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Si.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Ki.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Jun!
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Ionia still stands!
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Cut them off!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Ionia calls!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Break their lines!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Now!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Stop their retreat!
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Leave none alive!
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Remember the Placidium!
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Well. Time to find my feet.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|When no one's around, I dance for myself.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|It's quiet now… Time to find my own rhythm.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|(Sigh of relief) Alone at last… I'll make the most of it.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|We must stay moving. Keep them guessing.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|I am the great river, flowing where I please.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|The Spirit revives me… I willnotdisappoint.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|My form was off… Can't let them see.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|It appears my dance continues.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|Ugh! Need to get my rhythm back.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|This is far from over. We have not yet begun to fight.

wavs/audio_0243.wav|Raise a hand to us, and you'll find it missing.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|We are all creations of the Spirit. Still—I must kill you.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|The eyes are the first line of defense.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Never again.

wavs/audio_0249.wav|Always expect them.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|I know they'll be back…
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Stay watchful, stay prepared.
wavs/audio_0252.wav|This time, we'll be waiting for them.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Fight for the First Lands!
