I'm going to remember this.
You know why I'm here.
You're in deep, friend.
Vengeance with a smile.
Oh come now.
Say your goodbyes.
Defend yourself!
Eyes on the cape.
You don't deserve life.
I'm afraid you must pay.
Too late to atone.
This is when I shoot you.
You earned this.
Take your comeuppance.
I don't envy you.
Have you no shame?
Confess!
Scoundrel!
Any last words?
You've been naughty.
Tsk, tsk.
Absolve... me.
That hurts...
Oh... I see...
Coming through!
Akshan, away!
Whoosh!
Watch your head!
It's as fun as it looks.
Heads up!
Hey! Grappling hook buddies! No? Okay, suit yourself.
I know you! You're that kid who stole the gauntlet.
Well if it isn't sentinel serious. Look at all the rules I'm breaking.
Greetings, fellow sentinel! How strange that we are not friends today. Oh, well.
You work with Viego, yes? Scoundrel by association!
You're from Shurima? And have a boomerang? We should hang out!
Silly Viego, we can't bring back those we've lost. I mean, I can but... not you.
Sorry, can't let you live. You understand.
Well. You look very guilty of something.
I've got something for you. It's... comeuppance.
I know what you're feeling. It's regret.
It's not too late to turn around you know.
I don't know how you live with yourself, but you won't have to for long.
Up, up and... maybe not.
That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life.
Hahaha! They never expect the grappling hook!
Consider yourself... absolved.
Now think about what you did.
Always hard taking a life. But I get over it.
That was quite satisfying.
Yeah. I'd say we're even.
You know you had that coming, right?
There, now everyone's happy. Except you.
Shadya would approve of this. I think. You never could tell with her.
So... this is what it's like to have friends.
This cape is not up to Sentinel Code. But, neither is the grappling hook, nor the boomerang.
We are not helpless. We are the ones who shape our destinies. Now, let's go shoot these villains in the face.
There is no such thing as fate. But there is such a thing as Akshan.
It's important to stride into the wind so the cape flutters dramatically behind.
Vengeance is not a healthy impulse. Here's to bad health!
Some people say I hold a grudge too long but... those people are dead.
What else can I add to this gun? Maybe a shovel. No-a ladder!
How does this boomerang return? Someday I'm going to learn its secrets.
'Don't use the absolver', they said. 'No one must wield such a weapon'. Eh, I disagree.
Not everything happens for a reason. Some things need to be sorted out.
You try to rest and some lowlife kills one of your pals. Such is life.
They take one of mine. I take one of theirs.
Here we go. Get in. Avenge fallen ally. Get out.
A friend has gone silent. Let's wake them up shall we?
The bad part about having friends? Always having to avenge them.
I can feel them shaking in their armor. I love this part.
Listen to them. 'Oh no, is Akshan coming to kill me?' Hahahahaha. I am!
Shadya would not approve of this act of vengeance but... she wouldn't approve of a lot of things.
I hear the dead crying out for vengeance. I am coming, friend!
Killing this person won't bring my friend back. Actually, it will! Let's go do that.
He who takes a life bears its mark on his soul.
Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later.
Some people just don't want to pay with their lives.
A villain will show you much when they don't know you are watching.
I once knew someone who followed the rules. She's dead.
I do not break rules. I bend them. Ever so slightly.
Just desserts coming right up.
Curse this nagging conscience of mine.
A scoundrel left alone will always be a scoundrel.
People without grappling hooks, what are they thinking?
Once they see me, it is too late for forgiveness.
Who am I to decide who lives and dies? Huh. Just a guy.
Mmm, yes. Villainy is near.
Death? I laugh at death! Ha! Listen to me laugh!
Okay, villains. Time to soil yourselves.
Talk is worthless. We are what we do.
I've got quite a few tricks up my cape.
I live by my own code. Don't be an ass.
How well I know the silence of a lonely life.
Huh, nice place. Lotta things to swing from.
Can't talk. Sentinel business. Super important.
Ha ha! The thrill of going where you're not supposed to.
Some people deserve a low blow.
I hate shooting them in the back. I don't get to see their surprise.
Sometimes fate just needs a little nudge.
Things to do. Scores to settle.
The world won't save itself. You know.
Look at it go!
Ha! Boomerang!
All in the wrist.
Ha!
Watch it fly!
You're going to love this!
Here comes the 'uppance!
Oh, the anticipation!
Oh, so exciting!
Like the mysterious boomerang, I always return.
I come and go at unpredictable times. That is Akshan's thing!
Now for my grand escape. Grappling hook!
Right, then. Up we go!
Only one way out of this mess. Skyward!
Shadya's frowning at me now. I should've paid more attention to her lessons.
Someone gave me comeuppance? Ha! Who do they think they are?
Yes, yes. The guy who revives people died... I'm really going to hear about this one...
So... back at square one again. Let us proceed to a better square.
Well. This is embarrassing.
No shame in starting over! So I tell myself, anyway.
I taunt with my grappling hook. See how it taunts you? Taunt, taunt, taunt...
I'm back! Take note, evil!
Gotcha!
You're an easy one to find.
Knock, knock. Vengeance calling.
Ha! I have you now.
Miss me?
Hey! I snuck in.
That's right. It is I.
So... how's it going?
Ha! I have sneaked upon you!
Ha ha! Their eyes cannot find me.
Stealth tiiime! I mean... Stealth time...
To the shadows... where the scoundrels hide.
Ohohoho, I love sneaking.
Sometimes, I even sneak up on myself!
Yes, yes. You can thank me later.
Have a good rest?
Dear friends, please stop dying. -Love, Akshan.
Reclaimed by the light! Yadda-yadda-yadda...
There you are. Welcome back.
It was nothing. Really.
You are reclaimed. Go! Live!
Let's try not to do that again, hm?
Fixing the world, one scoundrel at a time!
