Draven out!
This is where Draven shines.
Seems to be blood everywhere I go.
Stand back.
Hit 'em where it hurts.
I have the best job.
Something need killin'?
Hear that? Death's knocking.
Watch and learn.
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Woo!
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Woo! Yeah! Yeah!
Draven does it allâ€¦ with style!
Not Draven; Draaaaven.
Subtle? I don't do subtle.
I've got pain to serve.
Doesn't get better than this.
No followin' these footsteps.
Let's admire me for a bit.
Got axes, need victims.
Perfection? I got that.
Places to go, me to see.
Now this is how to move.
Don't be jealous.
I'll take that.
Why, thank you!
Here we go.
Nice axe, I'll take it.
Draven out!
Draven's makin' an exit.
Who wants some Draven? Heheheh.
Come out and play. Heheheh.
