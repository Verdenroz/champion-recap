wavs/audio_0001.wav|'Ey, never pick a fight you can't win.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Fist, meet face.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Only one of us is leavin'.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|You callin' me out?
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Gotta put the stamp on 'em.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|You're in my pit now.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|What'd you say 'bout my Momma?
wavs/audio_0008.wav|What 'chu got?
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Take your best shot.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Let's get to work.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|This is the part where you bleed.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|You got nerve.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Bring the ruckus.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Someone hold my coat.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Let's give 'em a show.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Pay up!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|'Sup, meat?
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Ring the bell.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|You wanna go?
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Tuck that chin, boss.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Guess it's on.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You know who you're messin' with?
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Better keep those hands up.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Catch these hands!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Come on, hit me!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Nothin' personal.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Bust 'em up!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Let's throw down!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You got my money?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Get punch-drunk.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Oh, look. A punchin' bag.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Free whoopin's!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Time for a chin check.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I want... a rematch...
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Wait...? Really...?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Tell my pa... I hate him.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Low... blow...
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Tell Ma... they started it...
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Four hundred eighty-three... and one.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Sorry... Ma...
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Good... fight...
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Play nice!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Facebreaker!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Bustin' heads!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Hey, Bilgerat. You see my pop? He'd be a scumbag like you.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|You Noxians ain't all bad. You ain't all good, either.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You Noxians may have started the fight pits, but I damn sure perfected 'em.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Hey, you're Noxian, just like my pa. I'll try not to hold it against ya.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You know the deal, Noxus. Stay outta my business, and I stay outta yours.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You know, my mom's a Vastaya. That's the only reason I ain't stomped you yet.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Look at you! Old blood Vastaya! You too good for me? Huh?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|You're about to see my human side—the part that ain't so nice.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Look at that face. It's just screamin' 'punch me'!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|You're the number one contender? Hah, I must've really cleaned out the division.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Welcome to my show! If you live, I'll have you back.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|If you even dream o' whoopin' me, you better wake up and apologize.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|My old man ran off. You'd be smart to do the same.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You got guts. Too bad I gotta put my fists through 'em.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Look sharp, meat! You're in the main event now.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|To be the boss, you gotta beat the boss. I don't see you bein' the boss.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Hah! I ain't about to lose to that.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I ain't never lost. You know that, right?
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Love you, Ma. See ya tomorrow. Mwah.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Someone get the cart!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Look out, there's a new boss 'round here!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Ooh... you should get some ice on that.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Get that money.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|You ain't the one.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Nope. Not a contender.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You might wanna stay down.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Get 'em off my floor.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Yeah... that's what I do.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|That's a KD... knocked-dead.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|That's a concussion.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Ya missed.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Wait, hold up. Are we gettin' paid for this?
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Five versus five? Heh. What kinda sicko is runnin' this rumble?
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Okay, everyone here knows how to throw a punch, right? 'Cause I don't have time for lessons.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Listen up, if any o' you don't die out there, I might have work for ya.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|The boss is here. Hold your applause... seriously, be quiet.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Hey, is there a doctor on hand? Asking for my opponents.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Hey, uh, listen... My Momma don't need to know about any o' this. 'Kay?
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|They say you learn a lot from a beating. If that's true, I've made the whole world smarter.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I used to risk my neck in the pit making someone else rich. Now, we do it the other way around. I like that better.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|When you're on top, there's always some chump trying to drag you down, pullin' at your feet, scuffin' up your nice shoes.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|They called me 'Sett the Beast-Boy Bastard.' Hah! Now, it's 'Sett the Beast-Man Bastard.'
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Looks like I brought my fists to a knife fight. Honestly, I feel bad for the knives.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I remember my first fight. I ran home cryin' to Momma... she wiped my tears with her claws.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Every single one of 'em thinks they're the one to beat me. 'Kay.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I don't like hurtin' people. I like the money I get from hurtin' people.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|My coat costs more than this whole damn place.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|They call me a thug. I call me an entrepreneur.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|If anyone's watching this fight... they owe me money.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Ah, the line of people trying to take me down just ain't long enough.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|I ain't no 'half-breed'... I'm a full breed, and I'm the only one.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Too hairy for humans, too smooth forVastaya. What're you gonna do?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I don't bother with jabs; if you're throwing, throw it hard.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Gah, probably shouldn't've have worn my nice pants to this.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|It's all fun and games 'til someone gets their face caved in.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|All words are fightin' words.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The crackin' of bones is the clinkin' of coins.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|No tappin' out in my pit.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|All men wanna be me, too bad they ain't me.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Everyone loses... well, almost everyone.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Some beatings you just gotta do yourself.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Somewhere out there is a demand that needs supplyin'.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Who's lookin' to lose a fight today?
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Y'know... you don't really know someone until you fought 'em to the death.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Ionia... place was so damn quiet before I came along.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Violence is my business, and business is booming.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Ugh... Hey, anyone know whose teeth are stuck in my knuckles?
wavs/audio_0114.wav|People say they don't like violence... but they all watch.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Glad I don't have to fight me.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Bein' the boss is a lot better than not bein' the boss.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Momma always said I had her temper.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Only thing an honest livin' makes you is broke.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|If I ever find my old man... well, I hope he's been trainin'.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Technique... is for lightweights.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|You swing on the boss? You better not miss.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Nothin' people hate more than a guy who makes somethin' of himself.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Must be a fight brewin', my fur just stood up.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Nothin' I hate more than people with sleeves.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|THIS IS GONNA HURT!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|NOW FOR THE FINISH!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|GOIN' FOR A RIDE!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Uh, be right back. Gotta check on some, uh... legitimate business.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Pause the fight! Forgot to stretch. Don't wanna pull nothin'.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Little break between rounds. Then, come out swingin'.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Y'know, life's really all about the quiet timebetweenbeatdowns.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Things I love... uh, my Momma, breakin' necks, and fine Ionian silk.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Hold up! Gotta ice the knuckles.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Ain't even thinkin' 'bout throwin' in the towel.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I almostfeltthat one!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Alright. I'm warmed up now.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|So, that's losin', huh? Not my favorite thing.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Aw great, did that leave a mark?
wavs/audio_0139.wav|It ain't how many times you get knocked down. It's how many times you get back up.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Well... when life gives you lemons, punch life in the throat.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Anyone wants a piece of me, line forms right here.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|It's easy to talk big when you still got all your teeth.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|You think I got where I am by listening to people?
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I'm undisputed.
