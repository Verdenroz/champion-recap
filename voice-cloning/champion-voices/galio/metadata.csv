wavs/audio_0001.wav|Back to sleep, then...
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Now this will be a fight for the ages.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Greetings, fellow large thing, let's fight!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Yes... now that's a fellow I can punch!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Hello, beautiful. What are you doing here?
wavs/audio_0006.wav|My wings versus yours. Let's go!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Ooh, a giant crystal? I'll fight it.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Greetings, giant glowing mineral! I must break you.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Heh, stone on stone!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Let us make violence, fellow rock man!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|It's like a weaker version of me.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|You're a sentinel? I'm a sentinel! We should fight!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|At last, a worthy opponent.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|There is only room for one of us.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Well hello there, handsome.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Well met, giant zapping man!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I got the big guy!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|What are you looking at?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Smash.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Bring it.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Not a fair fight.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|To battle!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Wanna go?
wavs/audio_0024.wav|It's punch o'clock!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|We don't have to fight. Let's do though!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Yes!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Hahaha! This never gets old.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Magic goes in, might comes out.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|So many things to squash!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Stone cold.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Justice.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Hmhm, people break.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Boom!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Punching time!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Crunch!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Go time!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Fight me, small warrior person!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|I. EAT. MAGIC!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Honor.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Good thing I don't bleed.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|So... what do you people do when you're not fighting?
wavs/audio_0042.wav|You're going to need some mending.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Smashing power amplified!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|A paginated collection of words!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|A book! Oh, just need someone to turn the pages for me.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Eh, never been much of a reader.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Armour, kinda makes you feel like you're made of stone.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Hmm... it doesn't fit. Well, guess I'll just hold it.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Cloth will protect my rock hard skin!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Can I exchange this for a size seven-thousand?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Glacial? Oh, that sounds big.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|"For the Frozen Throne!"""
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Protect me, tiny ice shield!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I know, I'll wear it as a ring!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Looks dangerous... let's fire it up!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Might need to loosen that a few hundred notches.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Belt's a... little tight.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|So cold, yet it makes me feel all warm inside.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Haha, ice fist!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Punchy spikes!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Unleash your power, magic frozen fist!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Hmm... looks red.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Haha! Tiny.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|To plug my cracks.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|I'll use it as a toothpick!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Make me stronger, purple zapping stick!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|That builds INTO something.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I don't know what this is. I bet it's great though!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Hmm... doesn't come with instructions.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Hehehe, I like buying person things.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I am cracked...
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Mend... me...
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I... crumble...
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Knuckle up!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Haymaker!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Punch!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Crack!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|To your face!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Better bite down!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Fist!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Aha!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Up you go!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Bustin' heads!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|To the chin!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Whammo!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Get your guard up!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Freedom punch!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Lights out!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Uppercut!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|ve always wanted to fight the sun. Let
wavs/audio_0091.wav|You're from space, huh? I'd fight space. Bring it on!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Hey, World Eater, I've got something you can snack on. It's my fist!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Dang right, Demacia!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Summon your god, painted priestess, and we'll see who's mightier.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|You're a Jarvan? I swear, I've met at least three others.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|You. Young girl person. Can you stay and accompany me wherever I go?
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Hm. How strange. No one bothered to sculpt you?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|So, what's it like living underwater? Fought any whales?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I like you, small blue thing. You're the one who doesn't change.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Back to your hole, giant crawly worm.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Hahaha! Ours would be a fight for the ages! They'd find pieces of us for miles around!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|You look horrid! I should give you the name of my sculptor.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Do not raise your claws at me, furry growly man.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Looks like I'll have to punch down. Hmph. Way down.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I don't fight small things. Come back with something bigger and meaner.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|What awful material were you sculpted from?
wavs/audio_0107.wav|My middle name is Justice. Galio Justice Justice.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Oops! Friendly fire.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Who's still standing?
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Hahahaha! Did we win yet?
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Squish, squish, squish!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Ooh, that was glorious.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Too easy.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Splat.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Squish.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Eww, dead guy in my toes.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Like a bug.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Next!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Vanquished!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|You know what's hard about fighting? Nothing! Come on, I'm made of stone.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I've got a high tolerance for magic. Takes a lot for me to feel it.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|As a symbol of this great nation, I say... let's go mess up some mages!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Know of any battles? Just looking to get my wings dirty.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|People are funny. They pass beneath me doing the same thing day after day.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I'd like to apologize in advance for ruining this place.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Let someone else be a statue, I got stuff to do.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I don't wake up 'til its time to squash something and I'm awake right now.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I love Demacia! It's the only place I've been.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|One people year is fifty Galio-years.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I'm going. You try moving three hundred tons.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|I'm a big man with big needs.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I might be made of stone, but that doesn't mean my heart is.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Apparently I'm some sort of big deal.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Excuse me, but... which king are we on now?
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Let's move! I've got people to inspire!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Do I get to crush that? Oh, please say yes!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Who wants to get protected?
wavs/audio_0139.wav|It's time to move! Shake off the moss.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Going to sleep means saying goodbye.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|People vanish! And new ones take their places! It must be magic.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Hahaha, majestic? Is that what I'm supposed to be?
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I don't break easy.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|It's hard to be a symbol, when you've got a soul.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|The best offense is a good magic absorbing colossus.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Which way's the fun?
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Whoa! I didn't know I had a tail!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|The best defense is me.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|I am not going back on the pedestal, not yet...
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Get behind me, huddled masses!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|I know, it's completely unfair. I didn't ask to be this impressive.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Ah, mages. I love the way they squish.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|They say I'm all made of petricite, I say I'm all guts!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I wish mountains had fists. That'd be a good fight.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|I love walking, it sounds like thunder!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I wish they'd chisel me a friend. Someone who won't break!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|People live such tiny lives!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|They made me to stop magic, and yet I hate when it's gone.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|I didn't choose to come to life, but I definitely prefer it.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Hmm, must be some powerful magic around here.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|I sleep, I wake, I break things
wavs/audio_0162.wav|What should I break next?
wavs/audio_0163.wav|It's not easy when everyone looks up to you.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I'm supposed to be a symbol. Of what, I'm not so sure.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Tragedy is worse when you can do nothing about it.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|I always wonder what lies beyond this land. Something to fight, I hope.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Ahh, feels good to stretch my wings.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|At last a change of scenery!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Ah, the world, it goes by in a flash.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|They just don't make doorways big enough.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|I've seen much, not sure I understand it but... it... it happened.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Somehow I always end up in the center of everything.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|I fell in love with a crag-beast once. Oh... wasn't meant to be.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|The guy that made me, he was pretty good right?
wavs/audio_0175.wav|I fought a house once. I'm pretty sure I won.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Can someone please get the pigeons out of my head?
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Letmedo the heavy lifting.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|I don't know why life chose me, but I'm glad it did.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|I haven't been to many places, so I might as well like this one.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Big blast!
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Smash!
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Right!
wavs/audio_0183.wav|That's it!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|And back!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Hammer fist!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Feel the whoosh!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Whiff!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Wind!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Flap!
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Blow it down!
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Both wings!
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Wing blast!
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Feel the breeze!
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Wing punch!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|My wings, your face!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Hi everybody!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Need a break from clobbering.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Everyone stay put. I'll be right back.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Time for some fresh mortar.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Oh, I hate to miss out on the action...
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Demacia calls.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Phew! I'm tired of punching.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|How long was I out?
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Ah, how'd I get back here?
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Okay, new battle!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Well, we lost that one. Let's go fight something else!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|What happened? Was it a frost troll again?
wavs/audio_0208.wav|I am chiselled anew.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Hey, I remember this place.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Gargoyle? No, I'm more of a magic-nullifying colossus.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Hmph. Good thing I don't have ears.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|You speak a lot, loud talky thing.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Climb up here and say that my face.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|I'm sorry, I just woke up. Were we fighting?
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Didn't I fight you yesterday, or was that a different puny thing?
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Hey, you. Don't mess with Demacia. I saw you thinking about it.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Quick! Hide in my crevices.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Would you like to ride on my massive shoulder?
wavs/audio_0219.wav|Rest in my ample shade.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|Pick on someone my size!
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Take the first swing!
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Take your shot!
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Come get some!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Don't have long, let's fight!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Fight me! Now!
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Step right up!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Let's get rowdy!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Goin' somewhere?
wavs/audio_0230.wav|I can take it!
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Haha! Come here!
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Let's do this then!
wavs/audio_0233.wav|I'll take you all on!
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Time to make an impact!
