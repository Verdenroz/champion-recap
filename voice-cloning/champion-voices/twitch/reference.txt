I'm on to you!
I demand tribute!
Look what the pipes washed in.
Plenty more where that came from! Seriously, I carry a lot of ammo.
I greased these all myself.
I licked this bolt for you.
Ohoho, that's gonna fester.
How do you aim with all this light?
They'll have more holes than my favorite cheese.
Exterminatethis!
Shooting's easy. Aiming's hard.
Hope that gets infected.
I dealt it! It was me!
No touching!
Mine!
Ripe for the picking.
Stand still! My eyes are on the side of my head!
Would you make me a sandwich?
Aim, then shoot. Aim, then shoot.
It'll only hurt 'til you die.
My last whisper will be yogurt mold.
My last whisper will be maggot pie, ooh.
My last whisper will be street bacon.
My last whisper will be curdle pops.
My ears are tingling. My... tail is tingling.
You drink this?
Oof, this'll put hair on your tail.
Needs more... sludge.
Nobody sneaks into my turf.
Trespassers will be shot, then looted, then... chewed on for a while!
I need these for my stash.
Ah, a little stench and it'll be perfect.
Aww, this doesn't smell at all.
It's mine.Ilicked it.
Shiny, not for long.
Shiny? Ugh.
This will do.
You're looking a little green!
Stop moving my stench!
The only thing the sun's good for, is what it does to milk.
I have this... uncontrollable urge to follow you.
I see why everyone chases you.
Oohoohoo, Singed! You smell nice!
I thought this place could use a little gooping up!
You remind me of home.
I'm a connoisseur of the finer things!
Sneaking around really works up your appetite!
Always pack a snack a month in advance!
Ah, finally ripe!
Hey, what did I step in?
From out of the sewers comes... doom.
All roads lead to Rome
Rust is like more delicious mold.
Who's following me?
Hop on, lice.
They are the plague.
Watch your step.
Have you met my fleas?
Are you gonna finish that?
Aged like a fine egg.
Dip it in sewage... leave it in the sun for a while... oh, yes, that's perfect, yes!
Who let all these plants survive?
Ohoho, yes, yes...
Spongebob Squarepants
Don't trust any liquid that you can see through.
It's sticky so you don't drop it.
Ugh, I can't even taste the air up here, bleugh.
They're planning something, I know it.
I'm on to you!
It's me! Hahahahaa!
Hi!
I was hiding! Hehehahaa, grr!
Oh, hello! Huhahahahaa!
I'll be right under their noses...
Time to go.
Sneaky, sneaky...
Sharethis!
Sewer skewers for everybody!
Pins and needles!
Respect the Rat
They can play this at your funeral.
I'm dedicating this piece to you.
One of these is going to get stuck in your head.
D'aww, it's not even stale yet!
Bleurgh, this tastes awful!
Trespassers will be gnawed.
Keep out.
I'm watching.
You're welcome!
I'm gonna want that back!
Now, there's a smell you can feel!
Here's something that won't wash off!
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
