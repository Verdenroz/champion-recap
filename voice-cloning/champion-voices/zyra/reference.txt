Soon...
None will escape my grasp!
What lurks beneath the soil?
Choke the life from them.
My prey thinks itself clever.
Death is in bloom.
The harvest is upon us.
Barbs!
Whip vine!
Briar!
Lash!
Our seasons are reversed: my spring, your fall.
Where are your friends? Mine are all around.
A promising garden.
Just a harmless flower.
Wait until my seeds take root.
Such a busy world.
Venture off the beaten path.
The forest holds many surprises.
Take careful steps.
Things aren't always what they seem.
So much more to see.
Come closer.
Pierce!
Burst!
Sprout!
Bloom!
No place is safe while I'm free!
StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm
Just wait...
Live...
Be ready...
Soon...
Feel the thorns' embrace.
