Gwen_Original_Death_5.wav|gwen|en|Not yet! I promised...
Gwen_Original_E_0.wav|gwen|en|With haste!
Gwen_Original_E_1.wav|gwen|en|I'm gone!

Gwen_Original_E_3.wav|gwen|en|Quick quick!
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterAkshan.wav|gwen|en|Akshan, you've made the sentinels proud. Don't let them down.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterIrelia.wav|gwen|en|Irelia, you saved the land. It's an honor to cross blades.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterLucian.wav|gwen|en|Lucian, quite the journey we had. Are you still a good shot?
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterLux.wav|gwen|en|You seem happy, Lux, but you know pain too. Why deny it?
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterMalphite.wav|gwen|en|A talking mountain. Now, what shall I say to you when you fall?
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterOlaf.wav|gwen|en|Olaf, my friend. Still looking for a glorious death?
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterOrnn.wav|gwen|en|A giant ram who sharpens scissors. Why... dreams do come true!
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterRiven.wav|gwen|en|Riven. A little thread and that blade will be as good as new.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterSenna.wav|gwen|en|I've missed you, Senna. Let's give our best, for Isolde.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterSeraphine.wav|gwen|en|A stage, a voice, is that really all you are?
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterThresh.wav|gwen|en|Thresh; no matter your formâ€”I've faced you once. I'll do it again.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterVayne.wav|gwen|en|Sentinel, maybe the world would look better without those dark glasses.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterVex.wav|gwen|en|Vex, you can be happy for the right reasons. I'll prove it.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterViego.wav|gwen|en|Viego. You never deserved love. Especially not hers.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterYasuo.wav|gwen|en|Yasuo, your clothes are truly terrible.
Gwen_Original_FirstEncounterYorick.wav|gwen|en|Please take care of the maiden... or I won't go easy on you.
Gwen_Original_Joke.wav|gwen|en|Just like the good old times. Sweet, simple, and out of control!
Gwen_Original_JokeResponse.wav|gwen|en|Bad jokes are a waste of life!
Gwen_Original_KillAkshan.wav|gwen|en|I know your tricks, Akshan. Do better.
Gwen_Original_KillIrelia.wav|gwen|en|Irelia, that wasn't the hero who saved the land.
Gwen_Original_KillLucian.wav|gwen|en|Good try, Lucian. I'll tell Senna you 'got me good'.
Gwen_Original_KillLux.wav|gwen|en|No running from pain, Lux. Next time, shine through it.
Gwen_Original_KillOlaf.wav|gwen|en|You're most welcome, Olaf. I promised you'd die with glory.

Gwen_Original_KillSeraphine.wav|gwen|en|A pretty voice, Seraphine. What a shame that's all you were.
Gwen_Original_KillThresh.wav|gwen|en|I suppose you didn't plan for that. How unlike you, Thresh.
Gwen_Original_KillVayne.wav|gwen|en|Vayne, you're a sentinel! I'd expect more.
Gwen_Original_KillVex.wav|gwen|en|Vex, next time give joy a chance.
Gwen_Original_KillViego.wav|gwen|en|She pitied you. I never did.
Gwen_Original_KillYasuo.wav|gwen|en|Oh! The wind feels nice again.
Gwen_Original_KillYorick.wav|gwen|en|Don't worry, I'll show the maiden how to smile.
Gwen_Original_Kill_0.wav|gwen|en|No stitching that back together.
Gwen_Original_Kill_1.wav|gwen|en|No time to rest.
Gwen_Original_Kill_2.wav|gwen|en|I feel so alive!
Gwen_Original_Kill_3.wav|gwen|en|I won't let you hurt anyone!
Gwen_Original_Kill_4.wav|gwen|en|Another down, I'm getting good.
Gwen_Original_Kill_5.wav|gwen|en|Try again! I dare you!
Gwen_Original_Kill_6.wav|gwen|en|Ha, how foolish!
Gwen_Original_Kill_7.wav|gwen|en|She'd be proud.
Gwen_Original_Kill_8.wav|gwen|en|I did that! Me!
Gwen_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|gwen|en|Scissors, needles, thread; tools of Isolde. She'll always be with me, and I with her.
Gwen_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|gwen|en|What a strange, wonderful world. I must make sure it stays that way.
Gwen_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|gwen|en|Edward Scissorhands
Gwen_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|gwen|en|Alright everyone. First, we must win. After, I'll be glad to fix any clothes, hair, or broken spirits.
Gwen_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|gwen|en|Bits of fabric can become something beautiful. My work here can do just the same!
Gwen_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|gwen|en|I remember when she sewed my dress with these scissors. Now, they cut a different cloth.
Gwen_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|gwen|en|Oh, are those mountains beyond the cliffs? I've always wished to see one up close!
Gwen_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|gwen|en|It's called the Hallowed Mist, but how it feels matters more. Warm, safe, like nothing can hurt me.
Gwen_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|gwen|en|This place certainly brings out the fight in everyone. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't present my best.
Gwen_Original_Move_0.wav|gwen|en|I've certainly endured far worse than this.
Gwen_Original_Move_1.wav|gwen|en|Edward Scissorhands
Gwen_Original_Move_11.wav|gwen|en|The memories I stitch here will be my own.
Gwen_Original_Move_12.wav|gwen|en|I've got to make each footprint mean something.
Gwen_Original_Move_13.wav|gwen|en|The wind at my back feels so good. I can't lose this. I won't.
Gwen_Original_Move_14.wav|gwen|en|What happens next, I get to decide!
Gwen_Original_Move_15.wav|gwen|en|The Black Mist won't hurt anyone. I promise.
Gwen_Original_Move_16.wav|gwen|en|They're trying to stop me. Well, they can keep on trying!
Gwen_Original_Move_17.wav|gwen|en|If only she were here to see this... see me.
Gwen_Original_Move_18.wav|gwen|en|I will experience everything like I never could before!
Gwen_Original_Move_19.wav|gwen|en|The struggle is worth it.
Gwen_Original_Move_2.wav|gwen|en|These turrets look strong, it'll be quite fun cutting them down!
Gwen_Original_Move_20.wav|gwen|en|Onward!
Gwen_Original_Move_21.wav|gwen|en|This is better than a dream. It's real, and I won't ever forget it!
Gwen_Original_Move_22.wav|gwen|en|Oh, what to do!
Gwen_Original_Move_23.wav|gwen|en|No one said life would be easy. That is its charm, to be sure.
Gwen_Original_Move_24.wav|gwen|en|Seeing my dress twirl reminds me to smile.
Gwen_Original_Move_3.wav|gwen|en|I'll make sure my allies feel the joy they deserve!
Gwen_Original_Move_4.wav|gwen|en|I'll break as many needles as it takes to get this right.
Gwen_Original_Move_5.wav|gwen|en|I sense their resolve. No matter, mine will be stronger.
Gwen_Original_Move_6.wav|gwen|en|Don't waste a minute!
Gwen_Original_Move_7.wav|gwen|en|Isolde. Wherever you are, I know you'll be alright.
Gwen_Original_Move_8.wav|gwen|en|I must hurry if I am to win.
Gwen_Original_Move_9.wav|gwen|en|Ahh, that brisk, fresh air!
Gwen_Original_Q_1.wav|gwen|en|To shreds!
Gwen_Original_Q_3.wav|gwen|en|Cut through!
Gwen_Original_Q_4.wav|gwen|en|Snip snip!
Gwen_Original_Q_5.wav|gwen|en|Ha, to pieces!
Gwen_Original_R3_Activate_0.wav|gwen|en|Out of my way!
Gwen_Original_R3_Activate_1.wav|gwen|en|She's still with me!
Gwen_Original_R3_Activate_2.wav|gwen|en|Pin them down!
Gwen_Original_R_0.wav|gwen|en|Needles out!
Gwen_Original_R_1.wav|gwen|en|Go!
Gwen_Original_R_2.wav|gwen|en|Enough!
Gwen_Original_Recall_0.wav|gwen|en|Off we go, scissors!
Gwen_Original_Recall_1.wav|gwen|en|I learned this trick back home, and added my own misty touch!
Gwen_Original_Recall_2.wav|gwen|en|Hold on, I need to grab more supplies! Don't start a fight without me!
Gwen_Original_Respawn_0.wav|gwen|en|Ugh, I can't give up! Not now, not ever!
Gwen_Original_Respawn_1.wav|gwen|en|Oh? I thought I was lost, but I'm still here. I'm still alive!
Gwen_Original_Respawn_2.wav|gwen|en|Ugh, I can do this! For her, and for everyone!
Gwen_Original_Taunt.wav|gwen|en|I heard something. 'You are bad!' They said it, not me.
Gwen_Original_TauntResponse.wav|gwen|en|How sad, you must be broken on the inside.
Gwen_Original_W_0.wav|gwen|en|Hallowed protection.
Gwen_Original_W_1.wav|gwen|en|Safe and sound.
Gwen_Original_W_2.wav|gwen|en|Blessed mist!
Gwen_Original_W_3.wav|gwen|en|Hide and seek.
Gwen_Select.wav|gwen|en|Head high, chin up, scissors ready!
