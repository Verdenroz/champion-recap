Let me at 'em.
Not taking this place whileI'mhere, Nashor!
Don't want what you're heralding, thanks.
Hit me like you mean it!
Don't you let up now!
Now it's my turn.
Bring it on.
Think you can beatme?
Show me what you're made of!
Give me your best!
Yeah, yeah, I see ya.
Focus! Might learn something.
Need me to hold back?
Got a challenge for ya.
Quit fighting clean!
Come on, too easy!
Toughen up!
Heh, watch this!
Could do this with my eyes closed.
At least make me try!
This one's gotfire!
You cruisin' for a bruisin'?
You got guts.
Ica... thia...
You got me... good...
Come here!
Can't touch me!
Let's see you get outtathis!
That all you got?!
Yeesh, Aatrox, I thought war gavemeissues!
Facing the Ascended again! This oughta be good.
You are everything I standagainst, Void Empress! You'll go no further.
Your terror bears no teeth againstme, Cho'Gath.
Darkin—twisted by Shurima, fallen to the Void, bound to your weapon. I get it.
Fiora! Ready for a rematch?
ICATHIA!!There, a battle cry before your beatdown, Garen.
Heh-hey! Gragas! Whaddya say you and I grab a drink after this?
You testing me, Illaoi? I'm in.
Pride's powerful once it'searned, K'Sante. Let me demonstrate!
Aww, if it isn't the whipper-snapper in a Void wrapper. Care to spar?
Kassadin. Alone against the Void, it's only a matter o' time before it gets to ya.
Ughh, Kayle. Being so self-righteous takes all the fun outta fighting!
'Prophet of the Void'? Bet you didn't seethiscomin'!
I don'treadhistory, Nasus. I make it.
I don't hold grudges, Shuriman. But I don't hold back, either.
Void-born! I'll light the way back to the pit you crawled out of!
Zilean, a man of Icathia. You save the past, I've got the future.
You stretch first?  Be embarrassing if you pulled something.
We duel to the death! ...Or 'til you surrender, I'm not picky.
Don't care who you are or where you're from! Question is, can you fight?
Really don't wanna fight you! ...HA!Who am I kidding,line up.
Hold on—let me grab some more 'wisdom' and 'experience'!
Make it quick! I'm feeling peckish and got a boiled egg waiting for me.
Oh, this? Just a fancy-lookin' lamp, don't worry about it.
Show me something new; I'll even give you the first hit!
Wily one!
Eatin' good tonight!
Anglin' takes patience.
Life swims on.
And now... I wait.
Not bad! I'll have to remember that one for the road.
Couldn't even defeat me as a literal sword, Aatrox!
Thatwas over easy.
Keep your empire to yourself, 'feathers'!
'Void Empress'? More like 'Void... unimpressed.'
Shut your gullet, Cho'Gath!
Loosen up, Fiora! Tension ruins your technique.
Just getting started!
Solid warmup! Who's next?
Keep 'em comin'!
Icathian lamp: 1. Nazuman ntofos: 0.
Well, Kai'Sa, what did you learn?
Pipe down, prophet!
Nowyou'rehistory, Nasus!
Against any weapon, any army, anyone,I remain unmatched!
The croc that croaked. Seen everything now...
Turret had it comin'.
Tower looked at me funny.
They really just let me do that, huh?
All brick, no bite!
Next.
jack of all trades.
What you lacked in fortitude, you made up in... uh, dirt.
Shame. You coulda turned the tides with a bit more practice.
Good try! You almost left a scratch.
Hey! Let this light a fire under you.
Yes, you did just lose to a guy with a lamppost.
Still packs a wallop after all this time!
I never get tired of a worthy fight!
Looks like I'll be carrying more than my own weight today.
Listen here, people: I'm not here to clean up your messes! This is a lamp, not a mop!
If you get lost, look for my light! Unless, of course, it's lodged in somebody's skull.
Bearing the Light ofIcathiain a run-of-the-mill lantern? Just my style.
A battle, here? Huh, I thought they'd never ask!
Shed my old name a long time ago... Didn't deserve it anymore.
If my old Kohari comrades saw me now... hmm... they'd probably say I've lost my touch.
Felt lost before, but you know... I never felt defeated.
My flame's been burnin' a good while. Still haven't found someone worthy to carry the torch.
Living through rough times makes ya appreciate the simple things, like good company... or a hard-boiled egg.
Bravest hero I ever knew was just a kid. Here's to you, champ.
Love sittin' 'round the lamplight and counting my scars after a long day o' beatin' up bad guys.
Icathia fell, but the rest of the world won't follow! Not on my watch.
Back in my day, we didn't need fancy weapons! Hmph... still don't.
Hmm... Any good fishing spots 'round here?
Could go for a boiled egg right about now.
Learned every weapon, bested every opponent.
Old man with a lamp, comin' through!
Some say I'm battle-hardened! Hardly!
Always a reason to keep on keepin' on.
I'll test their mettle against my fire.
Gotta keep limber at my age.
Boldness is earned, win after win!
Picked up a few tricks during my wandering!
Last light of Icathia, first line of defense.
Might have to makeanotherheroic last stand!
These old bones haven't failed me yet!
Warriors, rulers, gods... they all bleed the same!
Well, the end o' the world isn't gonna stop itself.
Sky looks mighty free ofVoid! You're welcome.
Next fool to ask about my face gets amouthful o' lamp!
Nothing wrong with a life of peace... Could never find one myself.
No sword and shield beats old faithful!
Show meall your might!
Never one tolose!
Stand...fight!
Givin' the enemy a breather!
Oh, wait a second—forgot my fishing pole!
Key to being the best is knowing when to rest.
Time-out! Gotta sharpen my... lamp.
Gotta go, the eternal light needs more fuel!
Didn't seethatcomin', even though I've got... how many eyes?
Ouch! ...Don't much care for the humblin'.
Ooh, I'll be feelin'thatin the morning...
Not as spry as I used to be, I guess.
Can't tell if they just got lucky or if that took real skill.
Those knuckleheads are getting too rowdy!
Alright, now I put myserioushelmet on!
Got any senior discounts?
Shopkeep hitting me harder than my enemies...
Ugh. Inflation's really gettin' outta control...
Ha! Still trying to sell me anactualweapon!
Fighting words! My favorite kind.
Let's do this.
