wavs/audio_0001.wav|Think carefully, my friend.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Let's show our friends the door.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|When going gets tough, you call Braum.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Show me your best.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Sometimes, shield becomes smashing board.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|First we fight, then we eat.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Now I give more than harsh talking to!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|My shield is my sword.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Keep your spirits high.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Put away your worried face!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Troublemaker toss is best game.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Today we fight each other. Tomorrow, we may fight together.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Now this is fun!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Sometimes battle is unavoidable.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Think carefully, my friend.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Why not enjoy some warm milk instead?
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You hit like baby ram! No horns yet!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Take heart.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|This has the smell of a faraway land. Perhaps I shall see it one day.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|These shoes... they're too tight!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Ha ha! Perfect!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|To friends, I am snowfall. To enemies, I am avalanche!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|My shield will protect this shield!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|A shield for my shield? I like it!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Ooh! Now I need marshmallow.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Fire does the body good.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I've always wanted an on-fire cloak!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Ohoohoo, nice and toasty.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Sight is the key to victory. Also stone.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|No sneaking up on Braum this time.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|My shield is here for you.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|It is easy, see?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I'm having cold flashes.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Good shot! You'll get them next time.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Look! Your axes bounce right off!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Ah! A refreshing sea breeze!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Hm. It is windy today.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|You remind me of Agatha. Best cow back home.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Alistar! I have cow you should meet.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Mother gave me bear as child too, Annie.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Somethingfishyhere? Hehehehehe!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|What's your poison, Gragas? Mine's milk!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|After this, we share a drink! You like goat's milk?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Tryndamere! This is fun, right?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Are you having fun, my friend?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Your hair... we do not see things like this in the Freljord.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|The goats are wise; eat everything, climb everything, and if something kicks you, kick it back!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|When life gives you curdled milk, be patient. You get very good cheese!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Good times, good friends... what could be better?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Shall we begin?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Let's get going.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Now, what can we learn from fighting?
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Ah, new beginnings.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Is it the moustache? Who knows?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Always bring Braum!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Today will be exciting day!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|If they insist on a fight, I will oblige them.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|They may have many, but you have me.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Follow me, friends!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Ah! We are about to begin the fighting!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Mother always said: 'Don't lose!'
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Move like the herd.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Braum is on the job.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|No time for worrying.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You can always trust Braum.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Even heaviest door can be opened.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Hehe, life is good, no?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You are safe with Braum.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Nacho Libre
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I wonder what's around next corner.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Let us go.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|If you have problem, you come to me first.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Strike like ram!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Ah... returning home.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Hehe, time for a snack.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Back I go.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|See? That wasn't so bad.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Is very important to take time to rest.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Don't worry, Braum was trying little bit.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|If at first you do not succeed, please, tell me what it is like.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Train hard, little poro, and one day you will be strong like... baby!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Eat, eat and grow strong.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|You thought you were in trouble.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Stand behind Braum!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Braum is here!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|The heart is the strongest muscle.
