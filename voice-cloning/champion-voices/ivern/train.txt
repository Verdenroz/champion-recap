Happy to sit this one out.
Dragons and void beasts are beyond my aid.
Why aren't dragons andvoidbeasts friendlier?
I get the feeling dragons don't like me too much... Oh well!
That creature is not ofthisworld.
Nature isn't always gentle.
Let me help you grow.
Turn a new leaf.
Huh, I can be thorny too!
The scorpion must scorp.
Wake up!
When a tree hits you, listen.
You forced my limb.
Switch to a greener path.
Some buds need a little push to blossom.
Trust me, you need this.
Harm revisits those who harm.
It's okay, Gromp is a slow learner too.
So this is how the scorpion feels.
See the wonder!
How very hornet of me.
Haa!
Hah!
Hehehehe!
Hmph!
Tehee!
Uh!
Hahaa!
Ooh!
Haha!
Ehe!
Oops!
Poke!
Uh-- the ferns did it.
Nature strikes unseen.
Poke!
Who did that?! ...It was me.
The chameleons would be proud.
Sneak attack!
No one expects the sneaky clover.
Where did that come from?!
Surprises sting the most.
Pokey!
Poke.
Nothing in here but us, uh... stalks of grass!!
Poke.
I hope I don't outgrow these.
These are so much better than the mudloafers I've been using.
Oh, I love boots! Where do they go again?
This looks like it's going to grow on me!
Hey, it's a thingy... people... use! Thank you!
Take all the gold, I really don't need it.
Hah!
Hoo!
De-doo!
Whoo!
Timber!
Tree down!
Tree down!
Timber!
Timber!
Tree down!
The forest protects us all.
Nature's surprise!
A gift from the forest.
Be protected.
Use this gift well.
Sometimes I need to treat myself.
I've got two thumbs and a shield!
Life is so much more beautiful than death.
Finally, someone who understands nature like I do!
Mountain man, it's me! The tree guy!
Are you going to Treemoot this year? I'm going to dress up as a sassafras!
Obviously, you're not a gopher.
No need to be so thorny.
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Oh?
Oh.
That gets funnier every time I hear it!
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard!
Hmm. Fragrant, with notes of wormwood.
Be grateful for this moment. And this one. Oh, and this one. Oh, and this one's good too!
The druid abides.
Have an Ivern-crisp apple! Don't ask how I make them.
Once in a blue leaf, the earthworm will best the robin.
A variation of Ivern's Theme plays.
Live each day as if it's your first.
Feels good to stretch the ole beanstalks!
What a wonderful day! Gooseberries would love it.
The sunshine tastes so good today.
Hm, now where did I leave my roots?
I am never lost in the wilderness... only in conversations.
Daisy stampede when no one is watching.
I follow only the sun! A-and sometimes a river. This one time, a scorpion...
Never trust a butterfly with a secret.
Sun and rain are the only magic I need.
Life is such a strange miracle.
Trees love tickling each other's branches.
Laugh like a hyena, and friends will gallop to your side.
Every river reaches the ocean in its own way.
I grow my own food.
I wonder what adventure today has in store for all of us.
Animals have more to offer than warm pelts and meat.
Everything is connected in the strangest ways.
Ladybugs should really befriend inchworms.
I love how the grass is fluffy on my toes.
I'm having another eye-opening day.
Sprint like a snail, and you will never twist your ankle.
It's reassuring how alone we aren't.
I find that the stranger life gets, the more it seems to make sense.
I want to put my toes in the river.
I tread lightly so as not to hurt the dandelions.
Nothing beats the smell of vegetation.
One day, I'll root in one place and be everywhere.
I wonder what the ducks are plotting today.
Potatoes are always watching.
The cleverness of mushrooms always surprises me!
Brush just tickles my fancy.
I should go swimming later!
Danger is coming.
We are one.
Hunters overrun the forest.
Malice is afoot.
Do not linger here.
I am your friend!
I gift my spark!
We are connected!
May you blossom.
Our spirits are one.
Grant me your spirit.
Don't fret, Blue. Moss builds character.
Blue, stunning as always.
I'm telling you, Blue, you and Daisy would make a cute couple.
And how are the pebbles, Blue?
You look just like my friend Daisy.
Stay calm, Blue.
You know me, Blue.
Be peaceful, Brambleback.
You know me, Brambleback.
Brambleback always has the best jokes!
Don't start fights, Brambleback.
Looking good, Brambleback.
Brambleback, remember the Kumungu affair? I still think it was your fault.
Brambleback, thanks for helping the beavers move their lodge.
Hello!
Hey there!
Hello!
Hello.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
Gromp, no leap races now!
Gromp! The epitome of frogdom.
Lord Grompulous Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth. I am at your service, my liege.
You know me, Gromp.
Gromp, ribbit, Gromp.
Top of the morning, Gromp!
Few understand the true spirit of the noble Krugs.
Krugs, there's danger afoot.
You know me, Krugs.
Krugs, bring it in for a cuddle!
Hey, Krugs, how's the wife?
Krugs, you're a boulder amongst pebbles.
May I come near, Krugs?
I loved your last story, Krugs! Really need to punch up act three, though.
Settle down, Raptors.
Have you heard the Crimson Raptor's singing? She's come a long way.
When's the last time you had your beaks sharpened?
You know me, Raptors.
Have some bird seed.
Raptor friends! Looking good, guys!
I'll be back soon, Scuttles.
Poor thing, who bent your antenna?
Found any good crawdads lately, Scuttles? Let me know if you do!
Scuttles, you're a gentle crab and a scholar.
You know me, Scuttles.
Scuttles, relax.
I know I still owe you some razor clams, Scuttles. You know I'm good for it.
Everyone needs to run with a wolf pack every now and then.
Wolves hate being alone, even the lone ones.
I told you to get that second head looked at, Wolfy.
You know me, Wolves.
Don't stay long, Wolves.
No, Wolves, we're not playing fetch now.
Wolves, be still.
Let me help you grow.
Given freely to those in need.
Be valiant, like a honeybee.
A gift from the forest.
Sharing is caring—says the dung beetle.
Always replace whatever you take.
To take, one must first learn to give.
Nature gives so much more than it asks for in return.
Say hi to your spawn for me!
Hurry! Get to safety!
I will use your essence well.
I receive your power with gratitude.
Thank you, Blue!
They want to take your essence! Hide!
Red, Code Red! Flee!
Red! It's the Kumungu affair all over again!
Thank you, brother Brambleback!
Run, they seek to steal your fire!
See you later, Red!
Hide, Gromp, I'll find you later.
Return to your pond, Gromp.
Go in peace, friend.
Thank you, lord Gromp.
Hide, Krugs, run back to your wife!
Thank you, Krugs.
Live to finish your tale.
Fly along, now, danger is nigh!
Where did you Raptors get all this gold?
I treasure this essence.
Scuttle, watch the river for me.
Quick, Scuttle Crab, hide!
Nothing escapes a Scuttle Crab's perception.
Thanks, Scuttles!
Scuttle, keep an eye on that suspicious extradimensional monstrosity, would ya?
We'll play fetch later.
Thank you, dear Wolves.
Hunters on the prowl, run and hide!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Whahahaa!
Whoohoohoo!
Hoohoo!
Heha!
Whoo-hoooo!!
Ooh!
Whoohoo!
Whahaa!
Hah!
Careful, Daisy doesn't know her own strength!
Watch out, Daisy's really protective of me.
Daisy just loves to hug!
Daisy, be gentle.
Watch out, Daisy stampede!!!
I think Daisy has a crush on you!
Don't play possum! Daisy hates possums!
See you later, Daisy.
Bye, Daisy!
Bye, Daisy.
Thanks for playing, Daisy.
Bye bye, Daisy.
Daisy, up high!
Daisy!!!
High five, Daisy!
Daisy, break up the fight!
Meet my friend Daisy.
Daisy, high five!
High five, Daisy!
Daisy, gimme' some leaf!
Hmm? Oh, hello. Shhh. Hmm-hmm... Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Hm, this new body's a little stiff! Must be an oak!
Woooo! Hahow! Haha!
Dying isn't so bad—now that the dying part's over.
Haha! Woohoo, haha!
That old body was getting creaky.
Woohoo! Haha! Ta-da!
Woohoo!
The end of life is filled with life.
Yes, you too!
Good one!
Oh, you got me on that one!
Have an unusual day.
Be grateful for the breeze and the grass beneath your feet.
Let reverence for life take root in your heart.
I'm a tree-hugger, you should know that about me!
All life is precious, yes... even yours.
May the sun warm you, all of your days.
What shall I see?
Keep an eye out for new friends.
Never hurts to be carefully carefree.
Let me know if anyone tramples you.
Nature is always watching.
A worm's eye view often turns into a bird's eye view.
Oh, a feather-backed caterpillar!
Now, I'll see them see me.
Sprout.
Bloom!
Sprout!
Spring up.
Bloooom!
Spring up!
My favorite color is spring.
