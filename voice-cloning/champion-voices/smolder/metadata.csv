wavs/audio_0019.wav|Fire!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|You want some fire?
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I don't feel so good...
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Oww...!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Mommy...

wavs/audio_0025.wav|Why are you wearing a crown, Mr. Airyline Sol?
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Huh. Why's that armored guy smell like dragon?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Whoa! Scary ghost lady!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Wow! How'd you get so good at pretending to be people, Shyvana?
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Whoa, he must be the king ofthe ghost kingdom! I've gotta tell Marinos.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Roar! Beware the dragon's power! Hehe.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Do you play games?
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Hi, I'm Smolder!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Mom roars in determination.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Oh, my mom says 'hi' too.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|One day, I'll be so big that, if we played hide and seek, you could hide in my mouth.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Huh, whatcha doing?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Hoho, look at me, I'mpeople!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|I have no idea!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Smolder guffaws nonchalantly.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Mom growls inquisitively.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Whoa! I thought he'd be a lot tougher!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Blegh! Burning void goo.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Who's the best dragon?I'mthe best dragon!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Guess you didn't pay attention in dragon practice!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Go, Smolder~! Go, Smolder~!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Can ghosts even die?
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I'm going...
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Mom roars in disapproval.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Oooh, ahhh!Mwahahahahahaha, FOOLISH MORTALS!...Hey, where'd everybody go?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Shyvana! Why'd you have to be so mean?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Mom growls in disapproval.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I-Iswearit was like that when I found it...!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|What a nifty pile of rocks.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Aah! Oh, no! Not our fortress! Aw, no!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Yay, it stopped!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Check it out, mom! They're, like, creature people.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Mom roars in intense disapproval.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Hey, mom, check out his crown!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Woah, you sure don't like him.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Aww, I don't like hurting the little cute ones.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Ohoho, yeah! Did you see that, mom? Ismoked 'em!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Sorry 'bout that.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I hope you weren't nice. Then I'd feel bad!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|ROAR!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Their mom shoulda taught 'em not to pick fights they can't win!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|If I can't eat 'em, then why do they gotta smell so good?!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Heyyy, mom... I made some new friends, uh, I'm gonna go play with them real quick!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Heyyy, mom... I made some new friends, uh, I'm gonna go play with them real quick!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I heard that the royal family of Camaroar used to offer rings to my ancestors. Ha, those things must've been humongous.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I don't take orders from anyone. But, actually, I was just gonna explore around here anyway.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|My wings flap, my sneezes are flame-nados, and my super fire beam breaths are only getting stronger! No more getting treated like a hatchling!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Here he is! The most splendiferous prize ofCamaroar! Me! ...Aw, yeah! Way to go, Smolder...!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|My name's Ignacarious Gigantareno Rex Le Spes Offerentis, but my human friend named me Smolder.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Why's she gotta hover over me all the time? I can take care of myself.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Mom growls in disapproval.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|One time, I sneezed and burned down a whole forest. No, for real.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Humans are so weird. It's like one minute they're all small and round, and the next, they're all thin and wrinkly.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Haha,roar!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Mom growls in determination.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Mom hollers.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Whoa, you're the loudest mom in the entire world!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Mom roars in frustration.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Uh, m-maybe it's good no one else can understand her.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I miss playing dragon attack with Marinos. I wonder if his new baby will wanna play with me.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Imperial dragons are the best dragons! My mom says so.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Marinos' family is HUGE compared to just me and my mom. I know mom's mentioned some grandmother Viper lady, but I've never met her.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Isn't it so funny that, the whole time you were looking for me on those pretty islands, I was on another pretty island?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Isn't it so funny that, the whole time you were looking for me on those pretty islands, I was on another pretty island?
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I'm gonna be big and strong one day. Then they'll be sorry.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I'm gonna teach my new friends all my favorite games, like finders-not-keepers. They run around and collect a bunch of shiny stuff, and I get to keep it.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Mom, it's just a story.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|My best friend Marinos used to tell me all sorts of stories, like the one about the kingdom of ghosts.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|'Kay, I guess she's heard it before...
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Mom roars in intense disapproval.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Mom growls dispassionately.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|There's so much room to run around!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Gotta stay on my claws. Like mom always says, 'Rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!'
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Aw, Camaroar sounds so fun. Can we go now?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Ha, an imperial dragon does whatever he feels like doing.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Skies? Land? Flame? Haha. I was born to rule 'em all.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Everything's mine to play with.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Hey, mom? What are the fire thingies next to my ears called?
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Mom growls in determination.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Oh. Okay!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Swoosh!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I smell people!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Ooh, what's over there?
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Ugh, I'm so hungry I could eat a whole bunch ofgromps!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Ugh, fiiine.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Mom roars in disapproval.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Oh, no! It's a dragon! Aah, run away! Aah!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Do you see anything fun up there?
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Ooh, I'll find 'em.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Mom growls in determination.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Ugh, flying is hard.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Marino says people think there's no more imperial dragons. But he never lets me prove them wrong.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Need a little help!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Heads up!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|A hide-and-seek champion!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Roasted!

wavs/audio_0138.wav|Mom growls in determination.

wavs/audio_0145.wav|Mom roars attentively.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Oh, yeah, right... 'Thank you!'
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Smolder yawns.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Mom screeches sternly.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Okay, okay, I'm up.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Mom roars in affirmation.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Mom, stop, you're embarrassing me!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|At least I didn't end up in a tree again!
