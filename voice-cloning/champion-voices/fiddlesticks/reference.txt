So… afraid…
Just a story…
It's hunting us. It knows what we're afraid of.
I'm coming to help. Where are you? I can't see you. I. Can't. See you.
High above the rotten rows. Cloth and metal. Teeth and crows.
Through the field. Down the lane. Voices never heard again!
Fiddlesticks is just a fable. A story to scare children.
They haven't come back from the fields. It's been three days.
Fid-dle-sticks. End of men. Fid-dle-sticks. First of ten!
Once upon a time… once… upon a time!
Don't be scared. It can't hurt you.
To our end.
There's something in the field.
I'm lost. Won't anybody help me?
I'm so scared.
See? It's just a scarecrow.
Nothing to be afraid of.
Come closer. Closer…
It's dark. I can't find my way.
Who's out there? Show yourself.
Hungry.
Fiddlesticks… Fiddlesticks…
I hear crows.
It moves around at night.
All alone. Lost in the dark.
I'll help you. Follow my voice…
Is someone there?
Fear!
Harvest!
What is that? What is that?
Fear…
It's not dead.
Reap and sow. Reap and sow.
Afraid?
Fear…
