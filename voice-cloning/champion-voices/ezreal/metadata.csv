wavs/audio_0002.wav|This belongs in a museum. - So do you. Nazis... I hate these guys...
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Hey, your loss. But I get it.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|The uglier the monster, the more fun they are to shoot.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Stand back! Let an expert handle this.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Pick a timestream, kid.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Hey Garen! How's your sister?
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Heh, this is so us! Right, Lux?
wavs/audio_0009.wav|This is flirty fighting.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Aim for the legs...
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I'm gonna send you back to... wherever Yordles come from.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Leave Lux alone, Zoe!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I'm not even breaking a sweat.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Tell me the odds, I dare you!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|No time to waste!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Another day, another bullseye.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I'll handle this!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Time for a true display of skill.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|All part of the adventure.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|No sweat.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Watch and learn!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Obstacle, meet gauntlet.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Hard work? Not today!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|I'm a professional.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|I'll make this look easy.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Hah! I can blink and still not miss.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You're between me and glory.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Haha, I'm allergic to caution.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Magic? Comin' at you.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Oh-ho! It is so on.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|No problems here!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Gauntlet, let's clear a path.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|This is really worth ten times the asking price.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Can I get an itemized receipt? My accountant's way too good at his job.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Nice. You can send the bill to my uncle's museum.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Are you not intrigued?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Lot of good mages out there! None of them are this hot!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Over here!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Now I'm here!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Oh, a little girl! There's gotta be a twist. *gasps* It's the teddy bear, isn't it?!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Oh, cool. Great. They have an Ascended. This should be fun.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Hey, Ashe. I totally meant to return that Avarosan sculpture thingy. Is that an ice bow? That's a cool ice bow.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|A celestial dragon that throws stars. Well, this is totally normal. I can do this.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Everyone! Watch your coin purses!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Possession is 9/10ths of the law, Caitlyn. Those pre-Zaunite demon totems are mine fair and square.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Okay, Camille. Fork over thatBrackernCrystal.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Woo! Strong goggles game, Corki. Keep it up.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Darkin? We're gonna need a bigger army!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Jarro Lightfeather doesn't do autographs. Sorry.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Listen, I have met exactly one Demacian I've liked. By the way, has Lux mentioned me at all? Just curious.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Oh, okay, demigods! Well, universe, you seem to really want to screw with old Ezreal today!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Oh, please, we gotta deal withdemigods?!I really need to up my rate.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Demons? This is a job for Jarro Lightfeather.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Aw, crap, I opened a mirror dimension again! ...Does my hair really look like that?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Giantpetricitegargoyle. So it's gonna be one of those kind of days.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Hey, brainface, you are why no one likes Yordle inventors.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Can't manufacture magic in a lab, Jayce! Or good looks, for that matter.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|That mask is not art, Jhin. It's ancient history.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Nope! I did not sign up for Jinx-level crazy.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Hey, Lamb... is Wolf friendly?
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Oh, I've heard of theBlack Rose. Nasty reputation... I mean, uh, huge fan!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Lucian! It's me... Jarro Lightfeather.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I'm a mage. You're a mage. I'm blond. You're blonde. Doesn't it feel like we're made for each other?
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Hey, Lux! *clears throat* Hey, Lux. What're yah up to later? Let's hang.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Don't pretend you didn't see me, Lux. That doesn't work.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Hi, honey! Is it too soon to call you honey? It's too soon.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Why is it always about strength with Noxians? How about vulnerability for once?
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Can you forge me a matching gauntlet?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Heh! Piltovans! Always think they're the center of the universe.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Well, you are just terrifying, aren't you, Pyke?
wavs/audio_0071.wav|So... Rakan. How serious are you and Xayah? Just asking.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|What the heck is that?!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Hey, Ryze! Are you still hiding all those dangerous runes in one place? (louder) Should I not yell that?
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Shadow Isles... all that Black Mist has got to be protecting something really valuable.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Shurimans. Always thinking I appropriated their cultural heritage. They're not wrong.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Oh, c'mon! Sivir! I swear, I didn't know I was robbing your family's ossuary!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Throw some more rocks, Taliyah! I need targets to shoot!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Targonians... Hey, ten words or less, what exactly are you guys?
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Yeah, I get it. It's tough being handsome. Right, Taric?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Didn't expect unliving ghouls. Note to self: always expect unliving ghouls.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Vastaya! Just like inSantangelo's field guide!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Well hello, Xayah. You should know that I am pro-Vastayan rights.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Hey, Xerath! How come you didn't get a cool Ascended animal body?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Gahh, I'm too young for you, Zoe. Cradle-robber.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Zoe, you're ruining my chances with Lux!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Time to show 'em who's best. Spoiler: it's me.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Don't make me put my goggles on. They're decorative.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Hey there, gauntlet!  How ya doin', buddy?
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Do I wear my gauntlet... or does my gauntlet wear me?
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Ah. Watch this...  We will never speak of this again. Ever.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|There's somewhere else I gotta be. Literally anywhere else.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|This is no time for jokes. Your jokes. My jokes are great.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Never act like victory is assured. Even though it probably is.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|No applause, please! ...Okay, maybe just a bit of thunderous acclaim! ...A little?
wavs/audio_0095.wav|That escalated quickly.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Good job, everyone. Let's, uh... just keep doing whatever you were doing.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Cool guys never look back at explosions.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Oooh, I hope that wasn't a world heritage site.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I'll come back later and sift through the rubble for artifacts.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Everyone see that? No? Damn! Now I've got to go and do it again!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|They just don't make temple traps like they used to.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Name's Ezreal. E-Z-... oh, you're dead.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|And Ezreal is victorious!Ahhh! Yeah!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Take five, everyone. I got this.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I don't care where here is. Just point me toward adventure.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Yeah, yeah, yeah. World. Peril. Save it. I got it, I got it.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere...
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory... girls are watching.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Stick with me and you'll be fine. That's not a guarantee, by the way.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Oh, please don't die. I can't lose a sidekick. Not again.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Hey. We can do this! Well, I can do this. You, 50/50.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|This reminds me of discovering the spirit tomb of Ekrin.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I always know a shortcut.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|A beaten path is a boring path.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|No way to predict the twists and turns ahead. That's why I wing it!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Never met a problem I couldn't blast away with magic... that I don't even understand.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I use a fake name in Demacia: Jarro Lightfeather.Sentinel of Light, 8th Order. He's a national hero.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do... *cough* not have a college degree.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? ...Don't answer that.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was... not pretty.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something's impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a... jackal head, end of times... the usual. I just wanted this ruby scarab. It looked great on my mantle.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Ugh... water's cold. AHH! Something touched my foot!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|...And my boots are not waterproof. Fantastic.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|There's an unspoken law in archaeology: finders keepers.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Sounds dangerous. I'm in.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|True explorers follow the compass in their heart.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I'm always open to new ideas. My new ideas.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?
wavs/audio_0137.wav|I. Never. Miss. But I have been known to fire a warning shot or two...
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I hate the word 'steal.' I prefer 'liberate' or 'procure.'
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Exploration runs in my family. It's in my blood.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|No plan survives first contact with me.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Once it's a ruin, I can legally loot it.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I'm at my best when the world's on the brink of annihilation.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Who needs a map?
wavs/audio_0148.wav|The gauntlet's for show... the talent's all me.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Heha!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Gawk atthis!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Marvel atthat!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Blast 'em, gauntlet!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Maybe next time I'll open an eye.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|That's what skill feels like. Hurts, doesn't it?
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Oooh, that looked like it hurt.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Nice shot, me. High-five.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Can't learn that in a textbook.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|That was a, uh... that was a warning shot!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|I blame the terrain. Totally that rock's fault.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Must've ricocheted off a cricket or... something...
wavs/audio_0162.wav|It wasn't a miss. It was a... near-hit.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|We mages call this a warlock exit.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Ancient. Magic. Words.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Relax. I blindly teleport long distances all the time!
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Alright, guys. Don't miss me too much.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Whoa. Time out, everyone! Don't continue the fight without me!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Don't attempt anything glorious in my absence.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Back from the dead? That confirms it. I am a god.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Megamind.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I'll be omitting that little mishap from the expedition logs.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|I truly hope nobody saw that.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|If anyone asks, I didn't see any of these priceless artifacts for sale.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|This belongs in a museum. - So do you. Nazis... I hate these guys...
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Don't worry, I'm not the magic artifact police. Wait, are you?
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What are your weak spots again?
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Sick burn... probably? Wasn't listening.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Call me when the stakes are higher.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Yeah!
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Quest accepted! ...Wait, where are we going?
