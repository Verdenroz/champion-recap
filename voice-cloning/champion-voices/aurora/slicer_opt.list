Aurora_Original_Attack_12.wav|aurora|en|Leave me alone!
Aurora_Original_Attack_13.wav|aurora|en|You're in my personal space.
Aurora_Original_Attack_2.wav|aurora|en|Interesting choice.
Aurora_Original_Attack_3.wav|aurora|en|This is field research!
Aurora_Original_Attack_4.wav|aurora|en|Don't touch me.
Aurora_Original_Attack_5.wav|aurora|en|I have better things to do!
Aurora_Original_Attack_6.wav|aurora|en|Let's get this over with!
Aurora_Original_Attack_7.wav|aurora|en|You're angering the spirits!

Aurora_Original_Death_1.wav|aurora|en|Haestryr... I'm s-... sorry...
Aurora_Original_Death_2.wav|aurora|en|I haven't... done enough.
Aurora_Original_Death_3.wav|aurora|en|Back to the Spirit Realm...
Aurora_Original_E_0.wav|aurora|en|Through the looking glass!
Aurora_Original_E_2.wav|aurora|en|A door, unlocked!
Aurora_Original_E_3.wav|aurora|en|One realm, to another!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterAnivia.wav|aurora|en|Ysjarn, I've been searching for you. My friend Haestryr, heneedsyour help.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterAshe.wav|aurora|en|Ashe, you want to bridge theFreljord'sdivide. But unity isn't harmony.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterBewitching.wav|aurora|en|I'm something of a witch myself, you know!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterBriar.wav|aurora|en|You're not human. But... you're not a spirit either. You are however... Very loud.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterDemon.wav|aurora|en|The pain you carry... I've never seen anything like it.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterIllaoi.wav|aurora|en|Nagakabourosis your god, right? I'd love to know more.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterKindred.wav|aurora|en|Wolf and Lamb... I didn't think I'd meet you so soon!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterLissandra.wav|aurora|en|You are no witch, Lissandra. You're adisease.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterLuluVeigar.wav|aurora|en|Same hat? Same hat.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterOrnn.wav|aurora|en|Well met, Ramhaurg! I have so much to share with you since we last spoke!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterSpirit.wav|aurora|en|This is the culmination of my research. Spirit friend... I can help you!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterSwain.wav|aurora|en|I recognize those ravens. Are you their owner? Or, do they own you?
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterUdyr.wav|aurora|en|We meet again, spirit walker. Care to catch up after this?
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterVolibear.wav|aurora|en|I can feel you trying to invade my mind, Valhir. Cut it out...!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterYone.wav|aurora|en|You stain your blade with spirits, Yone! Why hurt what you can heal?
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterYordle.wav|aurora|en|"A yordle!! I've never seen one in the material realm before!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounterYuumi.wav|aurora|en|Aurora gasps.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|aurora|en|It seems we're temporary collaborators. I know just the topic to... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|aurora|en|Your chaos!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounter_2.wav|aurora|en|I've exceeded my capacity for social interaction today...!
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounter_3.wav|aurora|en|My work is at a critical juncture, so this interruption is not ideal.
Aurora_Original_FirstEncounter_4.wav|aurora|en|Oh, you're interested in spirits? I have so much to share! Where do I start...
Aurora_Original_Joke.wav|aurora|en|Ta-da! Hilarious, right?
Aurora_Original_JokeResponse.wav|aurora|en|That had the components of a joke, but... it wasn't funny.
Aurora_Original_KillAnivia.wav|aurora|en|Ysjarn, be reborn. Haestryr and I will find you again.
Aurora_Original_KillAshe.wav|aurora|en|Ashe, your ideas may be noble, but your execution is lacking.
Aurora_Original_KillIllaoi.wav|aurora|en|Thank you, Illaoi. I'll be adding theSerpent Islesto my list.
Aurora_Original_KillKindred.wav|aurora|en|I'll tell you when I'm ready to go, Kindred.

Aurora_Original_KillMinion_1.wav|aurora|en|So strange, yet so cute.
Aurora_Original_KillOrnn.wav|aurora|en|We'll talk later, Ramhaurg!
Aurora_Original_KillPenta.wav|aurora|en|Ah, finally! Now where was I?
Aurora_Original_KillSpirit.wav|aurora|en|I can still help...! Let me organize my notes, and we can try again.
Aurora_Original_KillTurret_1.wav|aurora|en|These turrets are not conducive to my work.
Aurora_Original_KillTurret_2.wav|aurora|en|That was... easy. Who constructed this?
Aurora_Original_KillUdyr.wav|aurora|en|See you again soon, spirit walker! I always appreciate our repartee.
Aurora_Original_KillVolibear.wav|aurora|en|Your feral nature doesn't scare me, Valhir.
Aurora_Original_KillYone.wav|aurora|en|Killing spirits willneverbring you peace, Yone.
Aurora_Original_KillYordle.wav|aurora|en|Where do yordles go when they die...? Back toBandle City?
Aurora_Original_Kill_0.wav|aurora|en|Bookmarked for later study.
Aurora_Original_Kill_1.wav|aurora|en|Enough of that, thank you.
Aurora_Original_Kill_2.wav|aurora|en|Well, that was a waste of my time.
Aurora_Original_Kill_3.wav|aurora|en|Back to work.
Aurora_Original_Kill_4.wav|aurora|en|You'll enjoy being a spirit, it's nice.
Aurora_Original_Kill_5.wav|aurora|en|Knowledge is power... Try reading a book.
Aurora_Original_Kill_6.wav|aurora|en|I lost my train of thought.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirstAllyOrnn.wav|aurora|en|It's such a relief to have you here, Ramhaurg. Our other colleagues are so... loud.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirstAllySpirit.wav|aurora|en|Ooh, another spirit! Wow, look at you! Oh... you're going that way? Okay, we'll talk later!
Aurora_Original_MoveFirstAllyUdyr.wav|aurora|en|Spirit walker; I'm looking forward to working with you again. I'll show you what I've learned.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|aurora|en|Unless you know anything about spirits or theSpirit Realm, you'd do well to let me focus on my work.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|aurora|en|Do any of you wanna talk about spirits? ...I'll assume that's a yes!
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|aurora|en|I have my book, my wand, my starting supplies... Do I need anything else? Okay... Let's go!
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|aurora|en|This region is teeming with wayward spirits. I'll find and help themall.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|aurora|en|Just so you all know, I'll be focused on my research. You can expect to receive my notes once I'm done.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|aurora|en|Spending time with others is exhausting. If I seem curt, don't take it personally.
Aurora_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|aurora|en|The worst fate for aDemi-godis to be forgotten. I won't let that happen to Haestryr.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|aurora|en|Okay. Let's go.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|aurora|en|I see the Spirit Realm and material realm simultaneously — this blended world is my own... and it's beautiful.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_10.wav|aurora|en|You know, technically, we're never more than five steps from a spirit.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_11.wav|aurora|en|This is far too much walking.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|aurora|en|Spirits become wayward by absorbing the pain of mortals. It's my job to cleanse what each wisp has endured.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|aurora|en|I want to help Haestryr more than anything, but I'm not strong enough... yet.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|aurora|en|The Spirit Realm, the material realm... they aren't mirror images, but two halves of one existence.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|aurora|en|So little is documented about the Spirit Realm — my work will help others understand what they can't see!
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|aurora|en|Once I'm done here, I'm going to celebrate by reviewing everything I've learned. I love paperwork.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_8.wav|aurora|en|We're all just a collection of fragile bones held together by sinew and muscle. At least I'll be a spirit in my next life.
Aurora_Original_MoveLong_9.wav|aurora|en|No one is ever truly alone: spirits are all around us!
Aurora_Original_MoveRiver.wav|aurora|en|Fascinating! I'll review this later.
Aurora_Original_Move_0.wav|aurora|en|Spirits aresolucky they're not people.
Aurora_Original_Move_1.wav|aurora|en|I quite enjoy my own company!
Aurora_Original_Move_10.wav|aurora|en|Auntie Havu would like it here. She loves drama.
Aurora_Original_Move_11.wav|aurora|en|I go where my research takes me.
Aurora_Original_Move_12.wav|aurora|en|How can anyone be afraid of ghosts? They're adorable!
Aurora_Original_Move_13.wav|aurora|en|Haestryr, my friend... I'll do all I can to help you.
Aurora_Original_Move_14.wav|aurora|en|Weaknesses can also be strengths.
Aurora_Original_Move_15.wav|aurora|en|I see, I see... very interesting.
Aurora_Original_Move_16.wav|aurora|en|Would anyone notice if I just...left.
Aurora_Original_Move_2.wav|aurora|en|Oh! I've read about this!
Aurora_Original_Move_3.wav|aurora|en|So few see the world as I do.
Aurora_Original_Move_4.wav|aurora|en|The sounds, the smells... I hate it.
Aurora_Original_Move_5.wav|aurora|en|The spirits here are different from the ones in theFreljord.
Aurora_Original_Move_6.wav|aurora|en|The spiritual balance here is... off.
Aurora_Original_Move_7.wav|aurora|en|I woke up early for this...
Aurora_Original_Move_8.wav|aurora|en|I should write home. So my... family knows I'm still alive.
Aurora_Original_Move_9.wav|aurora|en|I like when it's quiet — I can hear myself think.
Aurora_Original_P_0.wav|aurora|en|Follow me. I'll help you.
Aurora_Original_P_1.wav|aurora|en|Hope you don't mind the detour!
Aurora_Original_P_2.wav|aurora|en|You'll be safe with me.
Aurora_Original_P_3.wav|aurora|en|I appreciate the company.
Aurora_Original_P_4.wav|aurora|en|Let me guide you home.
Aurora_Original_P_5.wav|aurora|en|Hello, little spirit.
Aurora_Original_QRecast_0.wav|aurora|en|P-cha!
Aurora_Original_Q_0.wav|aurora|en|Open your mind!
Aurora_Original_Q_2.wav|aurora|en|Seemyworld!
Aurora_Original_Q_3.wav|aurora|en|With eyes unclouded.
Aurora_Original_Q_hit_0.wav|aurora|en|Beautiful, isn't it?
Aurora_Original_Q_hit_1.wav|aurora|en|Take it in.
Aurora_Original_Q_hit_2.wav|aurora|en|I see your spirit.
Aurora_Original_R_0.wav|aurora|en|My worlds converge!
Aurora_Original_R_1.wav|aurora|en|See between!
Aurora_Original_R_3.wav|aurora|en|You're in my realm now!
Aurora_Original_Recall_0.wav|aurora|en|Give me a second to decompress.
Aurora_Original_Recall_1.wav|aurora|en|Anyway. Bye.
Aurora_Original_Recall_2.wav|aurora|en|This is a lot to process... I'll return after a break in the Spirit Realm.
Aurora_Original_Recall_3.wav|aurora|en|How does anyone fight for this long... It's exhausting.
Aurora_Original_Recall_4.wav|aurora|en|I won't let Haestryr be forgotten! There has to be more I can do.
Aurora_Original_Recall_5.wav|aurora|en|The material realm is such an eye strain... One moment, I need a change of scenery.
Aurora_Original_Respawn_0.wav|aurora|en|Still corporeal... Oh well!
Aurora_Original_Respawn_1.wav|aurora|en|Okay, back to work! The spirits here still need me.
Aurora_Original_Respawn_2.wav|aurora|en|Oh, we're not done? ...We're still fighting? ...Okay.
Aurora_Original_Respawn_3.wav|aurora|en|Note to self: repeating previous actions may lead to unfavorable results.
Aurora_Original_Respawn_4.wav|aurora|en|That was... not ideal; but I won't let this derail me.
Aurora_Original_ShopOpen_0.wav|aurora|en|Everything is so... expensive.Explain.
Aurora_Original_ShopOpen_1.wav|aurora|en|No, I am not interested in purchasing any carrots.
Aurora_Original_ShopOpen_2.wav|aurora|en|Pewww... ding!
