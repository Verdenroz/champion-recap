wavs/audio_0001.wav|I have more important matters to attend to.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Know your place,demon.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You are nothing.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Soobvious.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Absolutely not.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Begone!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|A pedestrian ploy.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|This again.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Obey!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Get back.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I don't have time for this.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Wasted effort.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|WE'LL MEET… AGAIN…
wavs/audio_0014.wav|YOU HAVE… DOOMED US ALL…
wavs/audio_0015.wav|JUST… AS PLANNED…!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Bound to my service.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Sons, daughters, legacies. I'll take whatever you have, Ambessa!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Remember who it is you serve.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Youwere the ones who brought the world to its knees? That seems unlikely.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I have been warned against your kind, fallen one.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I have bound and banished more of your kind than I care to remember.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Who is caught in whose web, I wonder…?
wavs/audio_0023.wav|This betrayal is disappointing, sister—but not unexpected.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Tell me, Jarvan: what do you remember of your mother?
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Ahh, the young prince! You have your father's eyes…
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Katarina, still looking for father figures to disappoint?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I'll tear your family's name from the histories, Medarda!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I ended you once, you bastard! I will do it again!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You have something that belongs to me, rune mage.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Such ambition, Jericho. Such… arrogance. I can work with that.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Usurper…! You have ruinedten centuries of work!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|TheDu Couteauname is worthless, boy, aim higher.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|A tasteless homage to an unworthy role model, Veigar.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Must we do this again, Vladimir…
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Hemomancer—please.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|I could obliterate you where you stand. Convince me why I should not.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Congratulations, you found me. Or have you?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Consider your next moveverycarefully.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I reallydolook tired.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Dealing with you is… exhausting!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Pitifulcreature.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Almost too easy. Perhaps you're not the weapon I seek after all.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|And where is your god now, hm?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|If not me, then who?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|There is nothing more catastrophic to a kingdom, than an empty throne.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|So predictable—just like your mother.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Clearly, you did not learn from your mother's failings.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|HOW MANY TIMES MUST I DESTROY YOU, REVENANT?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|If I must become the whole world's villain, thenSO BE IT!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Tyruswas right about you.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|You showed such promise, Jericho Swain; what a waste.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Well… your sisters will be upset by that, no doubt.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Mortal vanity, undone by magic.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Bear witness to thefallof empires.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I will not be held back by these meager defenses.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Sleep now, little one, I will not give up on you.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|'Immortal'… and already outliving your usefulness.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Pathetic.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|You had every chance to turn back.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|May this be a warning to others!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I presume that was not the outcome you sought.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You will not be missed.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Eugh… You must be another ofVladimir'srevolting experiments.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Cassiopeia. You have sacrificed much for our cause; how much more are you willing to risk?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Elise, what news from theShadow Isles? What does theVilemawsee?
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Your power grows, Mel. Let me help you unlock your true potential.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You are only here because Ipermit it, Revenant! Remember that!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Ryze, youknowwhat happens to those who walk away from the Black Rose.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|It pains me to see you like this, Sion… You deserved better.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The people ofNoxussee only their 'Grand General', but I know who is really in control.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I grow weary of you, Vladimir. You should remedy that.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|You may be thinking that my face looks familiar. Perhaps you are right… or perhaps not.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|It is said that every rose has its thorns, but none are sharper than mine.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Until you have witnessed both the beginning and the end of an era, your desultory opinions matter very little to me.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|It matters not whether you are my ally or my enemy.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I have a plan. I won't hesitate to leave you behind, should you fail to play your part.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Though the pieces move across the board, only a fool would expect the same tired strategies to yield different results.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|What manner of flower may thrive without sunlight or sustenance? I know the answer—and soon, so shall all of Noxus.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Nothing burns as hot as the need for vengeance; especially when it has been stoked for centuries.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Do not trust someone who has never lost everything they care about.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I am not looking for counsel. If I wanted a second opinion, I would simply ask myself.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I took a rabble of barbarians and whispered to them dreams of empire—and look at them now: insatiable, unstoppable.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|The pale woman is nought but a reflection of a people's deepest fears and insecurities.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|They call me cruel. Indeed… from a mouse's perspective, even a lazy cat may be evil incarnate.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Incompetent leaders can easily be deposed. It is those who follow them who are the real problem.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Lies are like roses: marvel too long at the bloom, and one may miss the thorns benenath.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|My former master believed in destiny, domination and deceit—failing to realize the last would be his downfall.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Do not judge someone for what they are, but rather by what they do and say.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|The difference between the truth and lie can be… confusing to some.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I remember when Noxii was a curse against those who dwelt beyond the Sun's light. TypicalTargonianhubris.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Smoke and mirrors. Shadow and steel.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Unforeseen turns are simply part of any path.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Moving forward—never back.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I have a… unique view of this world. Several hundred of them, in fact.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|The plan must be followed to its completion.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|The greatest threat toNoxuslies within this upstartTrifarix.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|They speak so casually of tyranny and oppression. They do not know what I have endured.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I never asked for any of this, but I won't go back. Not now…
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Vision. Might. Guile. It's almost comical how history repeats itself.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|The scenario plays out over and over again.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I'll make this quick.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Up is down and night is day, if I say it is so.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|The Tragedy of Macbeth
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I am the answer to every question anyone has ever asked.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Secrets are coins better saved, than spent.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|In my experience, such artifacts do not belong in mortal hands.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Tell me more about your business plan, shopkeep.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|A strange place to set up shop—andtwomerchants here, no less.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|'Divide and conquer,' as it were.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I am a sisterhood of one.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|My sigil be upon you!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|You cannot hide from me…!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Youwillobey!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|This one is mine.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|You are marked!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|My knowledge of the arcane is unrivaled.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|This has gone on long enough.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Those fools underestimate me!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I said: move!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Outof my way!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|A new plan must be devised.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Try as I may, I cannotalwaysbe everywhere at once…!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I shall consult with my sisters and return.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|There are preparations I must make.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Failure is instructional.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|My return should come as no surprise to anyone at this point…
wavs/audio_0127.wav|My greatest strength is that there are so many of us…
wavs/audio_0128.wav|No matter—I will try again.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Revenge is a dish; the truth is a pit; words are weapons… Do you follow?
wavs/audio_0130.wav|How does eternity in asunless pitsound?
wavs/audio_0131.wav|There is little that escapes my notice.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Nothing transpires here that does not serve my purposes.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Stand aside.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|The Black Rose shall bloom once more.
