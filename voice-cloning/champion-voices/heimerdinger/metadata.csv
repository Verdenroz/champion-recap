wavs/audio_0001.wav|How befuddling!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I theorize... your defeat!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Testing in progress!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Stand back! I am about to do... science!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Working as intended!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Eureka!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|This will put a wrench in their plans!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|You are poorly designed for this!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Eureka!!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Exceeding turret output capacity!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|This calls for a prototype!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|What a reaction!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Stop that! You will damage my turrets!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I've applied the formula for success!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I require my adjustable reverse-ratcheting magnetic box wrench!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|This behaviour is highly inefficient!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Mind your vectors!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|They'll have a few screws loose by the end of this!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Ah, the sweet smell of science!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|A-haa!!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Ah, Jayce. Mind if I borrow some of your 'hexpertise'?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I don't agree with your methods, but by golly, do you get results!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Groundbreaking hextech innovation employed in the service... of punching.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|If you seek to replace all humans, there will be no one left to appreciate your work.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Would you mind taking your hexplosives elsewhere?
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Have you considered making quieter hexplosives?
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Your hexplosives are disturbing my research.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Why do chemists call helium, curium, and barium 'the medical elements'? Because, if you can't 'helium' or 'curium', you 'barium'! Hm hm!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|There are three key ingredients to invention: excessive imagination, good old fashioned stick-to-it-iveness, and a rocking good hairstyle!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Why do people say 'you can't trust atoms'? Because they 'make up everything'! Hehe!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|How befuddling!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Order, entropy; a never ending cycle. Or is it?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Hmm... let me fix that.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Hmm... very interesting!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Order, entropy; a never-ending cycle.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Aha!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Did I leave the Tridyminiumobulator on?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Just as I hypothesized!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I do love a good conundrum.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|The cosine of U-root, divided by...
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I could do that better.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|What an uncommon denominator!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Every problem solved is another revealed.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I concur!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Goggles on!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Yes, yes, hurry, I have important work to get back to!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Wonderfully efficient!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Bymycalculations...
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Back to the drawing board!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I put the scheme in schematic!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Fascinating, isn't it?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Brain over brawn!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Too many variables
wavs/audio_0054.wav|One step closer to greater understanding!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Hmm, it's smaller than the diagram.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Rise, my creation!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|It's gone mad!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|A-ha!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Aghnn... Dut-dut... What's that, ergh-... Come on. Enngh... ?! WAAAAAaaa—
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I would challenge you to a battle of wits, but I see you are unarmed!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Don't worry, you can learn so much from failure.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Perhaps I should trymorerockets!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|No, notallthe rockets!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Indeed, a wise choice.
