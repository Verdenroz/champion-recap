wavs/audio_0001.wav|Condemned to darkness, where our power grows.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Stone and spirit return to you.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Believe, Aphelios.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|You have bled, so they will.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Soul and skill converge.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|By light, the moon speaks!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|A reckoning in stone.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|They orbit their end.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Night embrace you!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|I send you… light.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Weapons aimed by destiny.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|It ends in silence.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|The power of your belief.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|For every phase, a weapon.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Carry the faith with you.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|In your hand. From my heart.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|No thought moves your hand.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|We hide no longer.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Born of night.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Every movement, a ceremony.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Reach out, Aphelios.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Until night is everything.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Your fight echoes even here.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Blessings of the moon.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|This will be your voice.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You are the moon's eclipse.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Through sacrifice, all things.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|An omen in your grasp.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Phel… I'm sorry.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I'll find you. I promise...
wavs/audio_0031.wav|No... I was supposed to help you! I knew…
wavs/audio_0032.wav|To become a vessel for the heavens, one only needs faith.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|The greatest power is the power greater than ourselves.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|The aspect of the moon. What is she fleeing? What has she done?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Our aspect has returned… bringing darkness.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Diana knows the moon's name, Aphelios. I can feel it on her heart.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|What do they hold if they only reach for the trigger?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|We were born to twin destinies, to tragedy, as the sisters were before us.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|The moon is with us in darkness, but it is not there for us.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Senna, in darkness, we find each other.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|The Solari do not see: we shine brightest with another's light.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Soraka knows our pain, yet tells us not to feel it. To deny ourselves.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Yuumi is much friendlier when she visits me in the spirit realm, snuggling at my feet while I read Book and imagine the rain.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|We have no enemies, Aphelios. Only those fated to meet us in the night.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Our faith will be tested.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Not even she knew what she would do. That was why she was afraid.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Mother moon, guide them.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|The heavens turn toward darkness. Now is our time.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|They are motes of dust, shimmering in moonlight.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|A prayer for their souls. Torn from the night.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|When you shine, the moon can worship. You did well, Aphelios.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|To make a life of death… you do what you have to, brother.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Hah.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Hah.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Only one of us is safe.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|You will not suffer in silence.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|We bleed when we cannot cry.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Blood upon still lips.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Phel, you're hurt.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Be careful, Phel.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|With every step, two steps. With every breath, two breaths.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Even from across the celestial veil… I will be with you, brother.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|It always starts with pain. We can only do this together, Aphelios.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Your life upon the altar, brother… I will not betray it.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Aphelios… I hear you. I know what you sacrifice.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|The pain makes you numb. But I can still feel, brother. I know the truth that pain hides.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You cannot feel the tear running down your cheek. I cannot wipe it away…
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I see further through the celestial veil. What we call truth is shadow.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You make yourself a weapon, so you do not have to feel. But you are not a weapon; you are my brother.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You will make death more than death, brother. You will make it holy.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|If pain is what awaits us in the darkness, brother… we must run to it, unafraid.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|It is as the moon revealed, Aphelios. As beautiful. As terrifying.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|The fortress looms around me. It is everything. It is the only thing.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Phel… You have made every movement a thousand times. Until you bleed. Until you do not have to think.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The Solari call us heretics, but when darkness comes, brother, they will need our light.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Our path is set between the last breaths taken by our enemies.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|What we want, what we need, what we must do… I envy the ignorant.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|The fortress is quiet. If only you could be here, Phel. You would make this stone seem loud.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Without pain, we would not need faith. The moon would not need us. We would not need each other, Aphelios.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Our thoughts touch… impossibly close. Which of us am I?
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Find your orbit, brother.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Again and again, I see you reach… for me.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Our destiny is hidden in the night.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|How can I help you when I put your life at risk?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I am right. This is what the moon tells me.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|You are the weapon the Lunari need.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|All we ask is for a witness to our sorrow.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Even when I close my eyes… I'll never look away.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Remember what you have learned, brother.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I'm never further than a whisper echoing in silence.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Beneath the mask of silence… I know your true face, brother.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Do not look back, Aphelios.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I am with you… shining above.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|We're in this together. Darkness and light.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|The moon shines brightest in darkness.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|From our fortress, I will guide you. I promise.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|As light reveals our path, so will darkness.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Each of us, an offering.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|We must find each other before every first light.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I am your sister. I am listening.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Walk where I cannot.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The brighter my light, the stronger your shadow.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I beseech the moon to protect you.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|You walk the path of darkness, but you do not walk it alone, brother.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|You are not alone. Remember our promise.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The dawn will know the night's silence.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|We walk through violence. Born of shadow. Born of light.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|We cannot let fear trap us in twilight.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Through your eyes, I see such wonders…
wavs/audio_0111.wav|When your steps falter, brother, follow my voice.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|You knew this would not be easy, the way forward written in scars.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|By my word, you walk into the night.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|The full moon reveals.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I will extend your reach, brother.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Moonlight will guide your aim.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Calibrum.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Death, arcing from your hand.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|An orbit of blades.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|The half moon, perfectly balanced.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Crescendum.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|A new moon. The same darkness.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|They will not escape what is coming.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Gravitum.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Darkness will weigh upon them.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Their steps will falter in darkness.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Cosmic flame will fill the night.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|The moon grows in flame.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Infernum.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Enlighten the many.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Harvest death for life.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Severum.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The moon gathers darkness on the crescent's edge.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|With every slash, resurrection.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I am with you.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I am with you!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Out of darkness, the moon is born anew.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|I will not let you die.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Faith, brother.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|As darkness falls, the moon rises.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|So many weapons, Aphelios. The deadliest is your faith.
