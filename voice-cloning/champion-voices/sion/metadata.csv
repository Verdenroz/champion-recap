wavs/audio_0001.wav|You reek of fear!
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I'll use their bones to pick my teeth.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|I must be sated!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I will kill you all!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Give me an enemy.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|My axe is getting cold!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|I'll pull you apart!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Blood will spill!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Your life is mine!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Bleed for me!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I'll whet my axe on your bones!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I'll drown you in your own blood!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I'll rip the meat from your bones!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Ally, enemy... I don't care.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I'll rip your head from your spine!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Drink their blood!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Your cries disgust me!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Raise your weapon!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|I'll grind you to dust!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Run from me!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I'll drink from your skull!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I taste blood in the air.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Killing, I know.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|They'll never find all your pieces.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Another corpse for the pile.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I will ruin you.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|More enemies!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I will break you!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|No mere spell will stop me.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|A sword lacks heft.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|This cleaver... will be red soon.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|This is not the first dead king's weapon I've taken.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|It longs to kill.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Nothing will keep me from battle.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Every step will crack the earth.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Good enough to stomp insects.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|These will wade through the blood of thousands.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|I'll shatter the gates of Demacia with this hammer!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Cold as the grip of death!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I'll feel their bodies grow cold.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|This will stop their flailing!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Ah... cold fear.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Do you feel a shiver down your spine?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|This will sever a thousand heads.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Spells... hmph.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|They will break first.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Protection from the bites of gnats.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|A dark omen for my enemies!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|All will burn in my wake.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Fire... good...
wavs/audio_0051.wav|They'll beg as they burn.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Leave no wound unanswered.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|This has seen many battles.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|This is the only fortress I need!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Battle scarred... I like it.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|This was made for war, as am I!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I'll bury it in their skulls.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Hand it over before I kill you.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|If it breaks, so will you.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I'll break it in.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|It will do.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Another trinket to be shattered.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I will drench it in their blood.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|The spoils of war.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Out of my way!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Worms!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You can't hide behind lackeys!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Scatter!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You're mine!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Is this what passes for war?!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Get up! Fight!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I know you... I want to remember killing you!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|One of us will finally die today!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Time to cut your strings, puppet!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|We've clashed a thousand times... no more!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Next in line, next to die.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I killed you once... I'll kill you again!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Today, we'll see if ghosts can bleed.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|I'll plant that banner in your corpse!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|You will be privileged to die... under my boot!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I am not your pawn, Swain!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|You are weak, Swain! You are no leader!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|You are not my general!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|How many Jarvans must I kill?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Four Jarvans, and you're all still failures! That is funny.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|You look just like your ancestor: dead!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Why don't I have coverage for prosthetics?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|So, uh, Urgot. We can't hang out any more. I'm cool now.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I had a funny bone, then I crushed it. Laugh, worm!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Your puny body is the only joke here.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Your... puny body is the only joke here.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|The mewling of your orphan children amuses me! How's that for funny?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|It's clobbering time!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Battle... yes!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|When does the killing start?
wavs/audio_0096.wav|It's been too long.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I hate this waiting.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|The quiet... eats at me.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Always marching.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Where are they?
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I... do not bleed.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|No... pain... no... feeling... but hunger...
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Our drums will drown out their screams.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Slay the strong, trample the weak!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Winning is like breathing.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Break their will and their bones.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Blood is the wine of victory.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Noxus suffers no cowards.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|What toll have I paid?
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Cowardice will be met with death.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Only cowards fear death.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Forget the faces of the slain.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Victory is soaked in blood.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Death had its chance.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|These wounds bring no pain.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|This hunger... it gnaws.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|How many battles have I won?
wavs/audio_0118.wav|What am I?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Where is the thrill of carnage?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I need a slaughter!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Why do I feel... nothing?
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Shattered earth and bodies!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Broken stone, broken bones!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|A black eye for the earth!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|You are worms!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Leave no stone unbroken!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Quake and die!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Die and be silent!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Crumble!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|You're nothing!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Even the ground trembles!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Feel that?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Cowaaaaards!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Noxus!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Nothing will stop me!
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Dieeeeee!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|I... Am... War!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Vermin!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|I'll crush you all!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|There's death to deal.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|The enemy awaits.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|This battle is done.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|They can cower a little longer.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I don't care what your name is!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Your snapping bones are music to my ears!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Come out and die!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|More grist for the mill of war!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Your bones will pave my road to glory!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|You reek of fear!
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Where are you going? Nowhere!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|This is the ground you'll die on!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Running is futile!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|A trap for vermin.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Show me the enemy.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Let them sneak, then let them die.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Is that all?
wavs/audio_0157.wav|The din of the dying!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I hear the screams!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Fire in my veins!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|My blood burns.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Heat... and... rage!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Think you can takeme?
wavs/audio_0163.wav|You can't even scratch me!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Rest is for the living.
