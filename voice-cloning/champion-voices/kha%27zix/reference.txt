They fear me.
Isolate and devour.
One by one.
Slice them apart.
Ah... delicious.
Blood in the air.
Clever creatures.
They fear me.
Devour their bones.
From the dark.
Strike from above.
Die running.

Kha'Zix screams and perishes.

I am living change.
Evolve and overcome.
They can't keep up.
They will not expect this!

My purpose is eating deadly creatures. My hobby is eating Yordles.
I ate an optimist once, but I couldn't keep him down.

Consume and adapt.
Position for ambush.
My wings are restless.
I will soar over them.
They won't know what ate them.
In the shadows.
Limb from limb.
Ready to reap.
Death from afar.
Pierce and skewer.
A different view.
I sense worthy prey.
Endless hunger.
This world is delicious!
Sharpening my claws.
Fear the Void.
No escape.
They'll never see me.

Do not fear death. The best part of you will live on!
If I eat you, will I learn how to die?
Hahaha. You're barely worth eating!
