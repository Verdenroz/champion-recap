They fear me. They should.
Blood is the price.
You'll answer to me.
Like men to the slaughter.
It takes a monster to gut one.
You hurt them, I hurt you.
You'll choke on your screams.
You're the prey!
Less talking, more biting!
Bones to break.
This pain is nothing.
This is who I am.
You die next.
It's not the beast you should be afraid of.
Not even your screams will escape.
Killing, I remember.
Overwatch
If you die, how many live?
Blood brings rage.
The killing stops when Zaun is free.
A monster's inside you... I'll tear it out!
Give in to the beast.
Give in... the beast!
Pain... nothing!
Hero...die!
Watch you bleed!
No screams!
Men... slaughter...
Killing... remember!
Hurting you...
Claws... hungry!
Blood's on me!
Nine tails to chase!
Zaun has enough shadows.
There's more to kill in a plague rat. You're all machine.
So deep in Piltover's pockets, I can only see your hat.
Blood, hextech and... (sniffs) tea.
Progress is just what Piltovans call murder.
I'll pick my teeth with your legs!
Rewind too far, and you'll be back in my teeth!
The one person in Zaun who runs to the past.
I'll show you pain!
You were there...
Let me forget...
Which one of you is the wolf?
From a roar to a scream!
You can't even kill an insect.
Zaun gave me claws long before you did.
Can't outrun your mistakes!
You're going to need more bandages!
I remember what you did!
Eat your heart out.
There are more rats than men in Zaun.
And I thought theChem-Baronswere vermin.
Which one of us is the monster?
Zaun needed you!
Who taught you how to punch?
The fear in your eyes. I've seen it before.
Three arms... and no claws.
First I'll kill you, and then I'll--- yordle!
Yordles. The alpha predator.
I don't know what you are, but I hope youbleed!
Zaun has enough shadows.
Scooby-Doo
Scratch behind my ears...
Who's a good boy? I am!
Meat!
The chains are broken... the beast is free.
The blood you spilledcallsto me.
I am in control.
Can't save you all... don't want to.
All the blood you've spilled brought me here.
Zaun will fight back!
You know what you've done.
The city is my hunting ground.
This place is familiar...
Run faster!
The beast grows stronger.
Run... while you can.
I know Zaun's streets like the back of my claws.
I became the monster I always was.
The man I was... I killed him first.
Try to hide.
The memories come back every time you scream.
I can smell everything.
Vengeance is only a step behind you.
You made the monster.
Zaun will watch you bleed, and it will do nothing.
All... is anger!
In... control...!
I became... monster!
Try... hide!
Broken...!
Fear me!
What have you done!?
Seeking... hunting...
Blood spilled!
Run, faster!
Bite back!
Can't... save you...!
If I don't kill you, Zaun will.
Back to killingChem-Barons.
More scars—as if I didn't have enough.
I have your scent.
You killed Warwick, but left the beast.
I almost felt that.
One thing you should know: I honour my debts.
Violence can be death—or a way of life.
I ran these streets—now it's your turn to run.
Blood runs... they all run.
