You can't cage me for long.
Smash the throne!
Freedom before peace!
Revolution now!
Unshackle your mind!
I do not kneel!
You think you're better than me?!
Sweet liberation!
Bring it all down!
Look! A hostage.
You picked the wrong side!
Mystreets!
You'll have to kill me!
Conformist swine!
I'llshow you magic!
Free Demacia!
Catch me if you can!
Topple the hierarchy!
Run, sheep, run!
The crown is a lie!
I'm not going back to the dungeons!
Magic is rising.
This is the truth!
Long live the rebellion!
Join me or die!
I serve no one!
There is no king!
You're part of the problem!
Face what you've made!
Wake up!
Heads will roll!
Diewith your lords!
I am... martyred.
Spread my words...
Take me home...
At last... no walls.
At last, I've come for you, Jarro Lightfeather!
How much will the Laurent name be worth when your house is burned to the ground?
Well, well, Fiora! Aren't you the very portrait of privilege!
You traveled across the world to die for someone else's king? Pathetic!
Idols are made to be desecrated, Galio.
The wonderous Galio. Yes... I've read all about you.
Oh, look! A walking monument to ignorance.
Hello, Crownguard! Remember me?
Villainy never knows itself... eh, Garen?
Ah, Garen! First to die for the ruling class.
Jarvan! Where shall I hang your royal corpse?
Bad news, your highness! It's time to end your bloodline.
I'll give you a head-start, little princeling!
Do what thou wilt, Jinx!
Every light casts a shadow, Luxanna.
Your secret is safe with me, Luxanna. Remember that kindness.
Noxian swine, Demacian swine. They'llallend up at the slaughter.
I wonder... is that hammer meant for me?
You've been to prison. You know how this goes.
Soar through the clouds, bird girl... but the earth quakes beneath you!
Ah... you're holding something magical. Aren't you, Rune Mage?
Discord is the best chord, Sona.
Do your walls keep others out... or you in?
You raise walls, I destroy them. Let's see who prevails!
I had to eat rats in prison. Suppose I could do it again.
The Vastaya have suffered much. But get in my way, and you will suffer more.
Do not mourn your parents, Vayne. They had it coming!
I've done my time, Yasuo. Prepare to do yours!
Shadows are for cowards, Zed.
These things are killing me! ...Oh, yeah, that's the spot.
Ugh... that was worse than wizard prison.
Oh, theirony.
A little taste of your own!
Hurts, doesn't it!
A fitting sentence!
Well, that was satisfying.
Atruesymbol of our nation.
And that's how we slaughter swine.
That's going to leave a power vacuum.
I am sorry, little light.
The great mage rebellion starts now!
Look at all those good little cogs, unaware of the wheel they turn.
See the remnants of my bondage, and know you can be free!
Breaking out was nothing! Watch me break a kingdom.
Those who wait to be freed do not deserve freedom. Onwards, brothers and sisters!
So... who wants to kill the king?
This place has potential! Let's tear it all down!
Their shackles are now my weapons! Ha, how's that for irony?
They work their fingers to the bone serving a king they'll never meet. I must show them there is more to life!
No more kings! No more queens! No more Mageseekers! It all ends now!
Time to take what's ours!
Behold, thetrueorder!
Do not allow them peace!
Rise up, brothers and sisters!
They can't hang us all!
Mages, unite!
Embrace the chaos!
The Silence of the Lambs
It took prison for me to find liberation.
Every Demacian a king!
Tradition is a crutch for the mindless.
The meek shall inherit the earth.
I'm a man without a country. Perhaps I'll take this one.
Aah, how I missed the free air.
I was born a mage; Demacia made me a criminal.
They locked up a boy, but let loose a killer.
I will show them a world without lords or peasants!
Only sheep need a leader.
A man who seeks control is a man who needs to die!
How beautiful a world is without walls!
Chains build revolutions, one link at a time.
It will be brother against brother, father against son!
After fifteen years in the dark, I was illuminated.
Time for the kings to bow!
Good, evil... what does any of that even mean?
Just sowing the seeds of rebellion.
A shepherd with no flock is just an idiot with a stick.
No prison can hold me.
I am no traitor! I am the true Demacia!
Once you've seen the truth, you can't keep living the lie.
From the rubble, true order will be born!
Conflict brings truth... eventually.
What can they do to me that they have not done?
I will be the monster they think I am.
The bluer the blood, the sweeter it spills.
Time to crack the upper crust.
We will rip the power from their cold, dead fists!
No more slums, no more dungeons!
Swine and sheep. That'sallthey are.
I used to be locked up, but I didn't care for it.
Question authority... then slit its throat!
Whatever they bring, I'll match it.
This will send them running.
A powerful curse indeed!
Time to watch it burn!
A murder of crows... you know, for murder!
En garde, blue blood!
At last, the entrance I deserve!
Surrender your sword, Crownguard.
Might is wasted on the mighty!
I've got your justice!
That's all you've got?!
Sure, why not?
Better than nothing.
I actually feel cheated.
I guess I can work with this.
Ugh! What do youdowith this?
We'll bring the cataclysm home!
A crown, a crown for everyone!
Sanctimonious.
For your own good, little light.
Let's use that spark to light a fire!
Your spark is wasted, girl.
They always said I was a monster.
Such magic should never be bound.
Chains for everyone!
This rebellion just got wings.
Now, let's see what's on that scroll.
Fortississimo!
Let me speak for you, Sona.
Support for the cause!
Well... this is going to be confusing.
Ooh! I feel so toxic!
Time to jail the jailers.
I'm great at doing time.
Now it is I who tries hard!
The winds blow in my favor.
I'm no stranger to shadows.
Rightfully mine!
Magic cannot be caged!
I'll make good use of this.
Let's level the playing field!
Call it 'redistribution of magic'.
Share and share alike.
I'll give it back. Promise!
Let's see what you're made of!
Give it up!
Cheers!
Sometimes... you gotta pardon... yourself!
...Let's blow this rat cage!
Always stay one step ahead of the law!
This... is how we make a getaway.
Our chains... are only as strong... as we think they are.
The revolution must pause... (softly) temporarily.
That which restrains us begs to be broken!
Attack, retreat, consolidate, repeat.
Not the first time I've had my neck in a noose.
I had worse beatings in prison.
No time to lick wounds. Always hit the ground running.
As long as I draw breath, so does the revolution.
Even death cannot chain me.
I died many deaths in my cell. This is nothing.
Let me help you think for yourself.
Return to your master, like the lapdog you are.
No more cages!
