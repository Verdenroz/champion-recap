wavs/audio_0066.wav|Blind 'em…
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Now they got blind spots.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Leave 'em in the dark.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Sunk the buoy.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|They can't see nothin' underwater.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Darker than a captain's soul.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Sun don't shine here no more.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Finally quit kickin'.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Welcome to the water.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Now to dump the body.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Another name off the list.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Butcher's bill came due.

wavs/audio_0083.wav|We're already on the menu, all we gotta do is crawl in the pot… Boil.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Went too deep. Part of me is still down there… swimming.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Every kill makes the voices louder… and I looove what they're screaming.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I've killed a lot of monsters. None of them lived in the sea.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|We're already drownin'—all we gotta do is open our mouths and let the water in.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|The rich man's a lyin' man, the lyin' man's… a dyin' man…
wavs/audio_0089.wav|No one's honest… 'til they get a knife in their gut.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|There's plenty of room for everyone at the bottom of the sea.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Tasted a good life once… Needed salt.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Everyone's got a million apologies in 'em.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|World don't do fair and equal! …But I do.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Everyone's gotta sink sometime.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|There's no sunken cities, just the swimming one.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|The world saw me drowning… and didnothing!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Sink like an anchor. Float like rum.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Everyone's fighting to keep their heads above water.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I sank so deep, there was no up or down.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Used to call 'em monsters, but they changed my mind.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Everyone sinks, till they don't no more.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Captainsalwaysfavor the ship over the crew.

wavs/audio_0104.wav|No oneswims in the same waters as me.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|The deeper I sank, the less I died.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|My kill list never gets shorter.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|People can drown pretty much anywhere.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|No one's been lower than me.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Not sure whose revenge I'm getting… Don't care.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Monsters lurk above the waves.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|The sea is everywhere I go.

wavs/audio_0116.wav|The surface won't be the top much longer.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I got friends everywhere… especially in the depths.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Work hard, die fast! The other way is worse.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The Dark Knight
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I'm still lost at sea.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Leviathans learn. People, I'm not so sure about.

wavs/audio_0123.wav|A war's brewing. I chose my side.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Solid ground… Feels too stable.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|I'm not the only one who wants revenge on everyone.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|We'll all be underwater soon.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|The bottom of the ocean ain't no part of this world.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Bottom of the sea's the top of another world.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|The crew on The Terror watched me get swallowed by a monster.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Last thing I ever drank was priceless.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I floated all the way to the bottom. Found there ain't none.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Captains told me to kill fish, fish told me to kill captains. Makes sense.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The only good captain's a drowned captain.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Killing—feels like home.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Deep folk have a way with persuasion.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Sometimes a shark takes the bait, and sinks the whole ship.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Hard-handed folk deserve a better death.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Krakens cry when you slice their throats… haunting sound.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|My new bosses don't care about gold.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Iknowwho I am… mostly…
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Dragon-sharks got teeth the size of butcher knives.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Went too deep. The deep came back with me.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Never trust anyone who cowers behind a desk.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Madness lurks below.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Salt water flows through my veins.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|My mind ain't all my own these days…
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Land folk think they're so smart, let's see 'em breathe underwater.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|I look down on the world from the bottom of the sea.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|I work better with a crew.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Sometimes you need an extra hand.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Backup woulda helped.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Needed extra hands.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|A crew comes in handy sometimes!
