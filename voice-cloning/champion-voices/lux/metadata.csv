wavs/audio_0006.wav|But all my light puns would've brightened your day.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Burn away the shadows!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|A beacon in battle.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Any excuse to twirl my wand!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|For justice, and all things bright!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Finish the fight!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is my choice.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Never deny who you are.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|The light of Demacia!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Hope you like rainbows!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Curiosity's gonna kill one of us.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Illuminate the enemy!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|If you hate magic, you're already blind.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Take courage in the light!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I have to focus, but I can't stop smiling!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Hey, who are you calling a lady?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Lights... out...
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Shine bright!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Banish the shadows.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|You condemn what you don't understand.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Are we supposed to be... dating... or something? We've never even talked.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Hey, sleepyhead, you coming to the fight or what?
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Sibling rivalry... this will be fun!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|I'm a Crownguard but you wear the crown. You're a Lightshield but I wield the light. But eh-uh-- I mean, metaphorically, your highness.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Kat and Garen sitting in a tree~ And you better just be holding hands or I'm telling!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|The Untouchables
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I'm sure your wife forgives you for getting her soul taken by a remorseless creature of darkness!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Demacia and Noxus are just lines on a map.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Do you ever charge into battle screaming, Aw, too bad.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|I don't get runes. I mean, are spells really that hard to remember?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|You know... you couldn't have shadows without light.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Sona! I'm your biggest fan! I even know what an Etwahl is!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Who do you want to be when you grow up?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Does this make me a lightweaver?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You look like you need a hug... but is it okay if I hold my nose?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Ahaha! I just got the joke!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Would it help if I apologized?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|The light will guide youâ€”even now.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I believe in you, not just Demacia.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|We're all so concerned about what Demaciais, we forget to ask what itcanbe.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|With my magic, and your anti-magic, there's nothing we can't accomplish.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Being a hero kind of runs in the family.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Taliyah, don't be afraid.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Demacia must lead by example.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|The sun is shining; we should too.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Together! For Demacia!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Pushing my limits.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Ooh, I've never been here before.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|If you can smile, you can be the light.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|We can do this!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Keep believing.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Shine with me.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|The superior tactic is to never give up.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Into battle with hearts aglow!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Lighting the way.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Stay positive.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Everywhere I go, the light follows.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I want to see everything.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I don't have dark secrets; I have bright ones!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|The world has seen enough darkness.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Stay there!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Binding light!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Demacia!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|By the light!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|No more holding back!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Losing is just an opportunity to shine even brighter.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|The thing about light is... it never really dies.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I'm telling Garen!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Hello, person-who-irrationally-wants-to-kill-me! It's so good to meet you!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|We should try being friends first, no?
wavs/audio_0077.wav|You don't like me? Well, I'd rather talk to a statue.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|We're in this together!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|I'll protect you!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Let's light it up!
