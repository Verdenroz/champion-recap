wavs/audio_0001.wav|Weak.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I could learn to trust someone like you.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Didn't expect the assist. Thanks.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Alright, I'll admit you helped.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|You're dependable. I like that.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|You'll watch my back? Just like that? Cool.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Don't get comfortable. I work alone.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Guess we're doing this!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|You can't fix what I break!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|This'll shut you up.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|This is who I am now!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Oh, we're fighting!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Don't say I didn't warn you!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Say goodbye to your teeth!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Hey, idiot!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|I'll bust you down to scrap!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You! You're in my way!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Alright. Die then.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Now I'm mad!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|This is for everyone I've lost!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I will kill you!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|They'll find you in pieces.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|You're nothing.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Out of my way!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Step up then!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|You're too soft for this!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You got a problem?!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Hope you brought an army!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Sit down!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I don't move for anyone!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Dumbest fight you've ever picked.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Do! Not! Push me!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|This is gonna suck for you!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I told you to stay back!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|I'm pissed!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Here comes an ass kicking!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I can't stop fighting...
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Get mean!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Toughen up!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Don't die!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I got you!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|We fight together!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Hey, snake. I'm gonna crush your bones.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You know my dad, General. So you know what's about to happen.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|O...Oh. So your name's Ekko? That's... that's cool. I'm cool.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Bet the rose would sure hate losing their pet bug.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You know I can see you, right? Gross little gerbil man...
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Hey, LeBlanc! Tell my mom I'm gonna rip her head off!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|All right, Rell. Be cool. It's just a tall, super-strong armored lady.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You're Mordekaiser, right? All metal. I can take you.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Samira. If you're looking for me, here I am.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|You're cute, Seraphine. Uh, well, bye.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|More like the boss of having his shirt off. Oh, I think he heard that.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Noxus will fall, Swain. Starting with you!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Boo, you suck.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I'm the happiest girl in the world...
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Wheeeeeeee.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|One dead snake, one less petal on the rose.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|You shoulda kept better tabs on your people, General.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Ugh. Just when I thought I knew him, he went back in time.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|One evil spider lady down, several evil animal people to go.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Your lizard had the right idea. 'General-Admiral-Brigadier' Kled.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Good. That'll send mom the message.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I hope this won't hurt my chances, Leona. Leona?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Noxus was afraid of that guy? This might be easier than I thought.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|No one beats me, no one breaks me, and no one stand in my way!'
wavs/audio_0067.wav|So long, Samira. Thought you'd be more stylish than that.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|We would not be good together, Sera.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Does this mean I'm your boss now? I gotta walk away, this is too much.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Hmph. 'Grand General.'
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Beaten by a girl, to death.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Let's try that again. Hi, I'm Rell.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Someone scrape this idiot off the floor.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Thanks for the practice, stupid.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Onto the next.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I told you not to fight me, but here we are.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I've kicked rocks tougher than you.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Fight like you mean it. Die for something that matters!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|This 'little girl' is about to crush some heads.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Run 'em all down! We're good, they're bad, and that's all you need to know.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|They'll pay for what happened to me. Noxus, The Black Rose... everyone.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The people who hurt me are dead. All but one. My mother.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|The Rose ripped the magic out of my friends and put it into me. I hate them.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Those academy kids are still out there. I'll find them all. I'll save them.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|When steel crashes against steel, it's so loud. I almost forget.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Memories suck.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|If I trusted people, I'd need even more armor.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I survived the academy. My 'instructors'... didn't.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Noxians aren't the heroes they think they are.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I'd rather break rules than people, but I can make exceptions.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Bones shatter and people lie, but I can always count on iron.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|The helpless fight. The hardened live.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|They call it ferromancy. Metal magic.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Forgiveness? Never.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Trust is a luxury no one can afford.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Forge your heart into something strong, unbreakable.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|The Rose wanted me to be a weapon. Well, here I am.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I'll twist Noxus until it snaps.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Friends just get in the way.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Hurt me enough and I'll split your head open.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I fight for the lost. But mostly, I just fight.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I'll finish this fight. I'm the only one who can.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|These sigils are a reminder. Screw my sigils.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Everyone who's ever stood in my way is dead or broken.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Don't let anyone in. Never let anyone in.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The Black Rose may have done this to me, but Noxus knew.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|The armor keeps the world out. The lance does the rest.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Nobody leaves!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Do not walk away!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I am not finished!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|All this waiting! I just want to fight!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|This sucks! I don't have time for this!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Come on! I hate waiting!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Can't tell if I taste metal or blood.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|'Excellence is measured in sacrifice,' or whatever.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|How 'bout you say that again?!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Iron body, iron will!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I refuse to be broken!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I'll fight to the end!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Let's do this for real!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|For the null!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Armoring up!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Unbreakable!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Run 'em down!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Ride!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Don't fall behind!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Mount up!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Let's crush 'em underhoof!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Nothing gets in, no one gets out.
