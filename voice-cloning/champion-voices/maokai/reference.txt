Your reckoning will come either way.
In the end, they all scream!
Protect what is pure.
I refuse to wilt.
Life torn from your grasp.
It is in my nature.
The blessed waters turn within me.
I will sow fear.
There is rot within!
I'll show you 'twisted'!
Rooted out.
The trees have learned violence.
So much life, stolen!
Bones break before branches.
Vengeance may be hollow, but so is my trunk!
It is good to ungnarl my limbs.
Your life bloom fades!
You defile the grove!
Madness!
To find life, I will snuff yours out.
Where men fall, saplings rise!
This power is mine to command.
How my branches groan!
Once this land knew solitude.
Life feeds on death!
Torment at your peril.
I wondered what happened to that tree.
I do tend to punch things.
From a land where the trees are hardy and tall... and very, very cold.
To strike a blow for nature.
Burn through the Mist.
Is it woven from branches? I can never tell.
Restoring life.
To aid the waters within my wood.
Flee, my saplings...
The forest...
To the soil...
Away, my sapling.
Seek the forest's foes.
Give them room to spread their leaves!
Patient as a tree.
One with nature.
Greenfather, my sapling wishes to meet you.
The Greenfather spreads life. The Mist will end it.
Careful, my sapling. Ivern is watching.
Does this make you uncomfortable, Bramblefoot?
I'd like you more if youwerea fox.
You create only destruction, Star Forger.
An axe is no danger if I cut you down first!
You make me glad I don't have ears.
Strength starts in the roots—and you have none.
Oh, what mortals will do for beauty. Kill, and wear pointy shoes.
Stop putting web in my branches!
I hear your skittering, mortal.
You give sticks a bad name—and fiddles too!
Stop carving words into my bark! Everyone knowsG <3 K!
Demacia's walls will not stop the Black Mist.
One of many shadows on the Isles. The Shadow of War.
Trample that blade of grass, horseman. I dare you.
Only men seek redemption.
Make like a tree and vacate the area.
Kill them withkindness?
The sapling of the god Willow.
A voice follows this one! A song, like those in the Mist!
It is the Isles that were betrayed!
Spirit of vengeance? And what of the forest?
The saplings wish to hear your dirge. Please, sing it... while Idestroyyou!
The song of life, now silent.
You make me glad I don't have ears.
I am no abomination!
The forest clings to life, and you would end it!
I am no abomination!
The forest clings to life, and you would end it!
Magic came from nature, and will return to nature.
Another pile of bones wearing a crown.
Rival tothe Ruined King—in ruin.
Darkness gathers on the Isles—from every depth.
Beware the mortals' gifts.
To bleed the bloodless.
Come and meet your end—and... a sapling or two.
Your existence was not meant to be.
There is still life enough within me to grant you death.
You make me glad I don't have ears.
A lantern? Ha! The forest is very dark indeed.
It is torture enough being near you, spirit.
The soul of the Isles is lost—beyond your grasp.
Yordle... Stay out of my trunk!
The Isles have forgotten more than just your name.
So you're what passes for a hero among the fleshlings?
You would scour the Isles without planting a seed.
Have you ever tried to dig through roots? Good luck, human.
A dangerous bloom, that one.
It was a mistake to become human. You will share their doom.
You forgot your roots!
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
I love all my saplings—especially how they taste.
The circle of life starts withdeath!
If only the humans were vegetarians.
Mortal to the end.
A friend of the forest no more.
Begone, vile spirit!
The Isles will be cleansed!
Another shadow.
To rest, if only you could.
Mortals? Hmph.
You would fight the forest in the forest?
Mortals always invading.
Blood makes the grass grow.
I would end your burden, but it always returns.
Wood knocks back!
Vengeance bears the sweetest fruit.
Enough bark, and there's no need for a bite.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Life can come back, once the earth is turned.
Hold tight, my sapling.
Beset by spirits, my home laid to waste!... And they callmetwisted.
The water of life succumbed to death. The mortals will follow.
The green in these plants, it is something I have lost.
I can watch the mortals doom themselves from here.
The young sprouts beneath my feet... they tremble.
Nature conceals darkness.
Once more into the grass.
There is life still untouched by the Mist.
Human nature? Pah!
Fight for the saplings!
Every step, defiance!
I cannot stop—the forest needs me.
We must pull up our roots; darkness corrupts the land.
Reckless mortals!
I will fight for every pebble, every blade of grass.
Living or dead, they are all the same.
The idol is over.
The Mist haunts my every move, yet I resist.
Once they were human. Now, they are only in my way.
Life here existed in a time before death.
Drink deep of what magic remains.
Now, where did I put that sapling...?
They trample life! I will trample them!
I will show them what was lost in theRuination.
Once my limbs reached for the sky, now for nearest mortal neck!
A shadow has fallen, as men have fallen.
I cannot find peace! Not even in the smallest branch!
I once had peace. It is better to have purpose!
There is beauty here, even now, in the human's fear.
Stillness is not peace! It is death!
I do nature's bidding... to the very end.
If I am already lost, I will take them with me.
Flee into the forest? Iamthe forest.
Mortals irritate me, like an itch beneath my bark.
I will punish their wickedness.
What have you wrought, mortals? What have I?
My heartwood is pure.
I will end this misuse of magic!
Stand back!
This will leave splinters!
Lashing roots!
Wretched souls!
Fools!
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Maokai's left arm laughs nonchalantly and then chokes.
Uprooted.
The grove beckons.
Hope blooms anew.
The maelstrom has not ended!
I rage against this curse!
Didn't even notch my trunk.
Another blade stuck in my bark.
In the end, darkness destroys itself.
I am nothing like you! I can't be!
For the forest to bloom, I will tolerate your presence.
Impressive words—but I'm a tree. I don't care.
No.
Silence, mortal. You only give voice to darkness.
The seeds of your destruction!
The sapling does not fall far from the treant!
If a human screams in the forest, will anyone hear it?
The Isles will bloom again!
