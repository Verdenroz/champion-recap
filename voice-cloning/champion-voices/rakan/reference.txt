Seriously? Seriously? Lame.
Be silent and live.
What you looking at?
Time to go to work!
Where you going? Where you going?
I have killed for her! I will kill for her again.
I'm gonna tear this placeup!
Yep! I'm amazing!
We will not fade away.
You're gonna love this!
This is you getting slapped!
I'm here! We can get it started!
They ain't ready! They. Ain't. Ready.
I feel alright!
You got something to say?
Let's get it!
Am I not magnificent?
Am I not magnificent?
Here's what's happening!
Nothing's fun without risk!
Pay attention! Woo!
Hell, let's do it!
I got some moves for ya!
I'm gonna slap all of you!
I'm right here!
Hey, what did the five fingers say to the face?
I'm incorrigible!
Look! I'm a distraction!
Want to see some sweet moves?
I can be very distracting!
What you looking at?
Dance or die!
I like parties with a little violence!
I can't die looking this good!
I got one more thing for you!
Time to get started!
You gonna feel this one!
I'm gonna hit 'em!
You will see the dance of death.
I need to get in it!
It ain't a party without a fight!
Oh! I need to get in there!
Hey! What you doing?
Let's get it started!
They gonna love this!
I'm gonna slap all of you!
Let's get interesting.
Let's dance!
Who... wants... to dance?
This is the message!
Hello? You ready for me?
I'm here to party!
Count it down! One, two, they dead!
You're gonna get hurt!
I don't do safe!
Damn, this is exciting!
Hey! I got a joke for you!
You will see my dance!
Hey, the party's over here!
This is all so intense!
Ain't gonna slow me down!
Woo! You animals are dumb!
I got some moves for you!
Look at me now!
Learn to dance!
Man, that's insulting!
You're welcome!
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
You gonna take that from me?
Can't stop me!
How's that face?
Watch me!
Say yeah!
Insulted yet?
My palm sends its regards!
Slap!
Try and hit me, fool!
Oh yeah!
Baby, I don't do safe!
Oh, this is all so intense!
You can't tell me you weren't impressed!
Just generally! I'm amazing!
I can't die looking this good!
After this, how about we get some human food?
Chocolate!
We're eating chocolate!
Nope, but let's do it!
I have a cunning plan.
I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!
I think you intimidate human females.
It's kinda hot!
Should I show them the dance?
You thinking about me?
That's very upsetting!
Try not to die?
Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?
Rakan has arrived!
Yeah! That's what I like!
Can I start off?
Let's start it off!
I'm a humble entertainer!
Yeah, I'm the best.
Who is that gorgeous thing over there?
It's always the time!
Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey.
I'm handling it, dear.
I was, Iâ€” I will.
How long do we fight?
Is that after lunch?
Uh... yes?
How will we know if the plan works?
I am not a piece of meat.
Caw caw, caw caw!
We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!
No one can control me!
Ha! When don't I?
If I vanish, what would you do?
Am I good to you?
I'm going rogue!
Be right back!
Who can know these things?
I know.
I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!
The fight's here!, by me!
Doing it!
Even me?
Should we give them a fighting chance?
Who do I hit?
Ah.
Good times!
Be my guest, miella!
You see that?
They'll never forget.
Happily.
You love it when I slap fools?
This is the plan, right?
What do you want to do later?
You hungry?
But... but... food!
Eyes on the prize, baby.
Let me at 'em!
I want to show 'em!
Do we need any of these fools?
Can't! Punching!
That was beautiful, baby!
I have your back!
Too long.
These guys look silly!
How many fights we gotta win?
That's my baby.
Did I do that?
Who's counting?
Miella, I helped, right?
Every time you do that, it drives me crazy.
Were... they trying?
I love watching you kill.
Let's make out.
Haha! Told you!
Did they deserve it?
Why do they break so easily?
Pity.
Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say,
Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!
They couldn't keep up with you.
Hey, Xayah.
You sexy.
That shouldn't be a problem.
You okay?
You're pushing yourself too hard.
Where are we going?
No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?
Yeah?
Well, try not to die then.
Darling?
Pay attention to me.
Back there?
I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking.
How can humans not hear the magic?
Why?
Thanks.
Not saying 'I told you so.'
What was?
You gonna marry me today?
I always do.
Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?
Love is so cruel!
What's after this?
Hm. Good.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey, I know that.
You know I love you.
Did you notice the sky?
Not as beautiful as you.
I am R-r-r-akan!
I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?
Hubba hubba.
No! I want to!
...nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me.
What are those things humans wear on their feet?
I need shoes. Red ones. I need themsobad.
Did I tell you I love you?
I love you.
Why do you never say yes?
Can we just stay here?
Aw...
Xayah? I think we got a problem...
I...knowwe got a problem?
You gotta rest, honey.
Everyone can wait.
What would you do if I died?
Aw... that's sweet.
Okay. I'll get more.
Wherever our hearts desire.
How do you like me today?
Every day of my life.
No. I'm the lucky one.
I'm fine with that.
Vi-om kaash.
Baasi sur ma-vae!
We won't get separated.
No, I'm not! ... only a little.
You are stunning and beautiful...
Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey.
If anybody's gonna die first, it's gonna be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is aterriblecolor on me.
Alright, let's go! This way or that way?
We have a plan?
Huh. Really?
I know what'll make you feel better...
Hey, I have a plan.
Yeah! I'll go on instinct!
You sure about this?
Be safe.
They always go wrong.
Mostly?
That's why I'm here.
So, this mission... are we, uh...?
Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do.
When are we going to do this?
I ain't gonna kill you. She is!
Kiss me, honey.
Give them a pretty last image.
At what?
Can we leave now?
Not like this...
Damn...
Open... casket...
I got you!
You okay?
I know you're Vastaya, but your tribe... lacks style!
So, just tiger stuff? Buddy, you've got to mix it up.
So, you just... run around in the jungle, huh? I mean, I'm not judging, if that's what you're into. Nerd.
Do you want to smell it?Not for you!
You want to smell it?No flower for you!
Girl thought she could pull out my soul. But I got too much soul!
What was with that girl's dumb purse?
Big girl had too much going on.
Your kind started this war. We will end it.
You put us in a cage? I put you in the ground!
I don't want to like killing, but this time, I did.
We don't want your harmony! We want our freedom!
I showed you the dance. You should've moved.
Punk ass cape.
Problem with that guy? No talent.
He had some style... for a human.
Fool thought he could upstageme?
Was that a land shark? I mean, why? Why is that a thing?
Six legs. Still couldn't dance.
Perfect predator? I got an instinct about how stupid that thing was.
You were given Vastayan blood, yet chose to be blind.
Power was not meant to be contained. Now, it is free.
Another. Dead. Poser.
Kind of feel bad for the guy. His feathers were weak.
Punk was trying too hard.
It is from our blood your gifts came, and my hand that took it back.
One animal at a time? Weak.
Hello, world! I am single now!
I bet she's gonna be angry about that later.
I miss her already. Oh well.
Well. I always was the pretty one.
I find this parallel universe stuff very upsetting.
You were a shadow without a flame.
You thought you got away?
I remembered your trespass.
Messed with my girl. What did you think I was going to do?
You came to visit us! Did you think we would forget?
Whoops. Now you are dead.
Party foul!
Oh! Can't touch this!
Got a feeling I shouldn't have done that.
Woo! I feel good!
Step up again, I'll slap you down again.
Come on, fool thought he could match my style?
Ugh. Sorry about that.
I'm not about killing, but I'll put in the work.
Also, your look is played out.
I got the deadly fresh style!
The dance is deadly.
You see this cape? Ha! I say goddamnI'm sexy!
Nothing important should be taken seriously.
Okay, everybody, I'm here, I'm here... the party starts now!
My fellow travelers, you are all about to witness my majestic epicness! ...unless I get killed, but... probably not!
Xayah? Xayah? Crap. What was I supposed to do?
Consequences only matter if I don't get away.
Magic is in the heart. Magic is in the rhythm.
I can't wait to get in there. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I am going toget in there!
War is in the dance.
Okay, Rakan, get 'em watching you, then you burn 'em up.
The humans call it battle. It's just a dance.
They will remember my name!
Our magic is a fury. It is a song you cannot resist.
It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth.
Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear.
Should I be... running? Yeah, I should... probably be running.
It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party.
Man, have you seen that forest over there?
Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly... but you too!
I don't do safe.
I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny.
Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second.
Danger is as fun as you let it be.
Magic is a wilderness.
Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!
They want us in cages. We refuse.
You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it.
The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song.
I dance so fine I kill.
Time to get it started!
I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!
I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music.
I dance because I'm free!
I'm going to take all they got, then laugh as I throw it away.
I got my look right, I got my moves right... time to show it!
I will walk in. I will dance. They will party.
If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party.
Don't leave nothing! Bring it all!
I don't want a war, but I want to be free.
I dance because I'm free.
I'm getting impatient.
They think they can catch me.
Humans made promises. More than I can remember. They kept none.
They will see me. They will see my dance!
I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?
This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise.
What human's call magic, we call life.
The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it and join the dance
I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!
For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air.
I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I'd die for. That's who I am.
I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?
I can't wait to see what I'm going to do.
I don't need to understand the plan! I trust my love.
Magic isn't supposed to be safe.
They're scared of darkness. They're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from.
Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here.
I'm just trying to live the moment.
It's a revolution. And it's good times.
They ain't ready for what I'm bringing!
I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone.
Feedback
I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music.
I'm gonna burn this place down, then help them build it back up... so I can burn it again!
Ain't nothing I say should be taken seriously! That's why it's the truth!
Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies.
Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain.
Fun. I need some fun. Now!
They will see my dance, then they will know magic's joy... and its fury.
Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna heal them.
I don't want a world that's safe.
Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse.
I am only as wild as magic.
They're gonna try and testme? Haha!
Humans think that to believe in something, you have to be serious about it. That's their problem.
Crayon
There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see.
If Xayah says someone has to die, they die. And they deserved it.
They've never seen moves like mine.
I'm gonna live forever!
Stayin' Alive
Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves.
It's all filthy and dangerous. And that's why I love it!
I can't die looking this good!
Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future.
I look good, I feel good, let's kick some ass!
I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously! Rude!
I don't need anything, but the right now.
The universe loves me.
I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations.
I am a chronic line-stepper.
They ain't seen moves like mine.
Ah... I miss Xayah.
Woo! I am so into this! What is this?
Why is it taking so long to get back to the action?
I will make them dance. I will make them hear.
I'm offended by how little attention I was given.
If you aren't a little frightened, you ain't alive.
Somebody?
Oh no, oh no!
Oh, hell nope!
Help!
This is bad!
I don't like this!
SOS!
Oh crap, oh crap!
Danger zone!
Yipes!
Careful!
Not good!
Something here!
Spooky!
Danger!
Watch it!
That ain't good!
Beware!
Be safe!
Look out!
Where are they?
Mysterious mystery!
What's happening?
They ain't here.
Heads up!
Where'd they go?
Nobody's here.
They gone?
What's going on?
They missing?
Bringing the fun!
I'mma coming, I'mma coming!
On the way!
Heading over!
Bringing the show!
There in a sec!
Running over!
On my way!
Here I come!
Coming, love!
Party starter!
This is the drop!
Oh! Yeah!
Can't stop me!
P.T.
You gotta keep up, baby!
Better hurry up!
Rakan out.
Wanna catch a ride?
Coming?
Is... 'totally bogus' your thing?
Hey, I'm right here. So, can you be less uptight and lame now?
You know, I ain't really about making fun of people, but you... make that difficult.
Can we just get started already?
Why are you so boring?
Man, are you digging this air?
I got three rules. You're breaking two of them with that outfit.
There's this thing called grooming. You should try it.
So, when you got dressed this morning, was this the look you were going for?
Oh, you're bumming me out.
I'll just put that there. That's a good place. I hope. Yeah...
Vision is the first step towards understanding.
I am not blind to any possibility.
When you open your eyes, you see everything is limitless.
Aw, crap, I hate having to have a plan.
Our kind will see the truth soon enough.
The world's a big place. Don't want to miss any of it.
Turn in, turn on, drop out.
I should totally get paid for this.
The sleeper must awaken.
I dig seeing stuff.
Peekaboo.
I know people are watching. How could they not be?
I need to see if people can see how awesome I am!
I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to scout around. Pretty, pretty sure.
I'm going to show people some of the strange.
Mankind is blind. I want them to see.
I think Xayah told me to improvise. At least, that's the only part of the plan I remember.
Yep, if I'm going to see the human world I need to start.
Well I don't want to miss the start of the party.
If you look at things the right way, it's awesome.
Let's see what's happening now.
Hello? Anybody there?
Every road leads someplace.
The world isn't about collecting stuff, it's about seeing stuff.
I need to know when the action's coming.
I want to feel everything. That's the only way to live.
Let's see what these animals can do.
I live in the moment.
Rakan, doing his job.
I... totally forgot why I'm here.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Sho!
Sho!
Sho!
