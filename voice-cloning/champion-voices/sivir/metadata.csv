wavs/audio_0001.wav|It's just business.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Here's where I get my cut.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Feed the jackals.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|This one's on me.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Crack 'em like a tomb.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Step light, strike hard.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Victory is what I'm paid for.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Don't get between me, and my gold.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Another fight, another fee.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You're worth my time... dead.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Life's cheap. Death pays.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Make me work for it.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I go where the trouble is.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Easy pay.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|It's just business.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|You die for free.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Back off!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Nice try.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Ascension is a problem, I'm the solution.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Keeping the Ascended in line is a full-time job.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Looks like trouble runs in the family, eh, Azir?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|That forked tongue could use a matching forked face.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Oh, look. I'm about to step on a snake.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|You always were a snake. Now you look the part.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Your inner beauty really shines through, Cassiopeia.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I could use a pair of croc-skin boots.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You'll make a nice bag.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Alright, Azir, let's put your Ascension to work.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|They say the desert is a cruel mistress. I like the sound of that.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Cut-purse? No. Cut-throat? Yes.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Send more goons, I think it's working.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Yeah. I am that good.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|This ismydesert.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I do my own dirty work.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Take back what's ours.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Come to my desert, pay my price.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Business is good.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Another contract completed.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You can't tame the desert.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I make my own fortune.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Laws are whatever works at the time.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Get paid, and get out.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Loyalty isn't earned. It's bought.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Wealth is my kind of burden.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I've got values - they stack up nicely.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Heroes go hungry.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Honor is the rust on a dull blade.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|The only thing I look up to is the sky.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|It's not stealing if they're dead.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You've got a problem, I've got a price.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I'll fight for a cause. I won't die for one.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Take this!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Look up. See the buzzards circling?
wavs/audio_0054.wav|You can't take it with you, so give it to me.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Takes a lot to stay at the top.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I always take my tollâ€”blood or gold.
