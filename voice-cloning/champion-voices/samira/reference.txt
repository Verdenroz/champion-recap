Eh, I could do better.
Oooh you look promising.
On my worst behavior.
I fight on my terms.
Next breath might be your last.
Let's make this fun!
Bah! Like Tereshni all over again.
Push off.
Oh lookie here. Target practice.
Came all this way to die? Hm?
You're mine.
Seize the moment!
Settle down sweet-cake.
Don't mess with me.
Well! Look at you.
Think fast!
I'll take care of this.
And I'm not even looking.
Finally some action!
Always bet on me.
I'm bored. Fight me!
Don't hold back. I won't.
Push my limits! I dare you.
Least I didn't die of boredom...
Style never fades...
Over here!
Eyes up!
Too slow!
Woo!
Keep up!
The sad mummy! My mﾄ［ﾄ］ used to tell stories about you when I was a girl. How I loved them.
Shurima. Needs. No. Emperor!
I know your type, Draven. The kind of man who's compensating for something.
That gauntlet would be better off without you, kid.
You seem kinda pale, LeBlanc. Sure you're getting enough sun?
Sarah, is it? I've killed many captains. Let's see how you measure up.
A talking turtle? Okay, maybe I did have one too many.
Sivir. You say you'll do anything for the right price, but what's the price of one's destiny?
Hey, old man. How long you got before that demon takes over?
Honestly, lantern man? Not sure you can handle my soul.
If it looks like a blood sucker and it sounds like a blood sucker... Maybe I ought to kill it.
Xerath. Your people ended my home. I will end your existence.
Ugh. I missed a freakin' cliff-diving trip for this crap?
Hm. How come no one ever tells me to reload?
Oh... I really gotta check these more often.
Huh. Less than yesterday at least.
Eh, I'm not here to make friends.
Don't worry, Azir. You'll be remembered... as a tyrant.
Maybe you should've smiled more.
Ah... what was your dumb name again?
Leave the kid, take the gauntlet.
Not the first LeBlanc I've killed. Probably not the last, either.
Your guns have a better home now Sarah.
Ohoho I'm just getting started!
Not sure if I just killed an ascended or some kid's lost pet. Ah, well.
Guess you don't need to run from destiny anymore, Sivir.
Be thankful I got to you before your demon did.
Don't say I didn't warn you lantern man.
Ugh, gross. Least my boots are looking brighter.
Shurima, no, the world is better off without you, Xerath.
Not sorry.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Idiot.
Ha! I win.
Flawless.
My time is precious. Your life is not.
Lucky for you the last thing you saw was me.
Done and dusted.
Messy, but effective.
I've got two rules for every fight. Don't ask for permission, don't ask for forgiveness.
Listen up, you sorry lot! Only one rule for this mission: take no prisoners.
If you can't keep up don't step up. I don't have time for fools.
Name's Samira. Try not to slow me down.
People always ask about my weapons. Right hand, Blaze. Left hand, Thorn. Vanquish on the back, eh! Simple as that.
Growing up, my mﾄ［ﾄ］ taught me one lesson. Death isn't the scariest thing. It's a mother's rage.
I care most about my warband or my family. Order changes depending on who gets on my nerves.
Born in Shurima, raised by Noxus. Maybe I'll die in Demacia to make things interesting, huh?
Sometimes, I'm the hero. Other times, I'm the villain. It's all a matter of perspective.
Those who followed the ascended burned away my home. So don't expect me to follow anyone.
Indari was a great captain. She taught me how to shoot. I taught myself how to kill.
Darius, Swain, pft! Those names mean little to me. I answer to myself.
If they think I kill for fame and fortune, ha! They're idiots, just like all the others.
I chose this life. And sure, someday it might get me killed... but 'til then, I'm unstoppable.
I'm the rose that survived the desert.
Danger runs from me.
Money buys a gun or two. Thrill buys a reputation.
Guns and swords go together like rice and saffron.
I don't work. I slay.
The empire values strength. I value style. We're good partners.
Hope I get some blood on these boots. The color's a bit dull.
I feel most alive when I'm walking the line.
Only need one eye to hit my mark.
Well-behaved women don't make it in Noxus.
Life's simple. Take the shot or lose the chance.
The ascended think they own my people. They are wrong.
In every girl, there is a queen.
Last person I loved thought I was too reckless. Their loss.
Why be average when I can be savage?
Oh, how great it would feel to shoot my past in the face.
Thrilling! Ha! Maybe I'll get a tattoo to celebrate the occasion.
Style
Heh! Nothing more lethal than comfort.
Some choose steel. Others, bullets. Why not both?
and
My folks keep telling me to settle down. Not my style.
'Refugee.' That label is where I draw my strength.
I'm not built to win. I'm built to conquer.
Virtues? I've got a few. Vices? Heh, a few more.
It's about to get messy.
Never look back!
Weapons hot!
My kind of rain!
No better time to die!
How did that old trick go again? Ah, right.
Taking a quick break. Try not to die while I'm gone.
This took years of practice... for everyone else.
Look out, guys, gals, and other pals. Samira's back!
Live fast. Die young.
Believe me, I've faced worse.
Another round. Ante up!
It's alright if you don't like me. We can't all have good taste.
Keep the change. You're gonna need it.
Devil May Cry 5
Buy something nice. On me.
Get a haircut. Trust me.
Nope!
Nice try.
Don't think so.
You want style? You've found her.
