There's always another wave.
They're puddle monsters at best.
Wash them away.
Welcome to the deep end.
Douse 'em.
Do not force my hand.
The ocean will sweep them away.
The seas are rising.
Soak it up.
Bottom feeders.
This is minnow's play.
The sea has no pity.
The sea holds fearsome creaturesâ€¦ and them.
I moonlight as a shark caller.
Sometimes you're the catch. Sometimes you're the bait.
Cool out, squirt.
Yeah!
I'll find my path.
Swim against the current.
Quit flopping around.
My people are counting on me.
My quest beckons.
Ride upon the waves.
Feet are strange.
Sure as the tides.
I will see my home again.
I still hear the song of the sea.
There's always another wave.
People and their air...
High tide!
Ocean, spill forth!
Afraid to get your feet wet?
Swim at your own risk.
I decide what the tide will bring.
