Humanity can be so much more.
Their bodies are frail.
Adapt, or be removed.
Relinquish the flesh.
Inferior constructs.
They are obsolete.
Destroy... then improve!
Listen close- urgh, I have important- urgh! This is why I can't take you nice places!
The key to the, uhh... huh? That is the, uhh... what? Urgh! Keep your hand to yourself!
Pave the way.
All will soon change.
Embrace progress.
Metal is perfection.
Analyzing approach.
I am the first of many.
Submit to my designs.
With utmost efficiency.
Function over form.
Behold!
Consume!
Obliterate!
True power!
Steel can fix all your flaws.
My opponents need to be upgraded.
The Hexcore can adapt to any power. Even yours.
For perfection.
Forget fear.
Incognizant soul.
Embrace evolution.
Change is inexorable.
Conflict is but a distraction.
You betray your future.
Renounce emotion.
Prepare your mind.
Unite.
Understand. Become.
A discordant mind.
No more division.
How wasteful.
Escape your imperfections.
Amalgamate.
My purpose...
No progress... no liberation.
No progress... no liberation.
My purpose...
Remove emotion.
Adapt.
End sentimentality.
Adapt.
End sentimentality.
Remove emotion.
I'm certainNoxussees the strength in my mission, Ambessa.
I see you have evolved all on your own, Blitzcrank.
Professor. Have you come to renounce your anti-Hexcore dogma?
Neither friendship nor love will stop what is necessary, Jayce.
Mel, as one embraced by the Arcane, you now know the true value of Hextech.
We've surpassed our feeble forms, Orianna. May the rest follow our lead.
It's not too late for humanity, doctor. I have the power to treat what ails them.
It is Hextech that holds the answers to your questions.
I sense... trepidation. But one cannot grow if left unchallenged.
Calamity thwarts hesitation. So which are you?
All will be clear once I open your mind.
You challenge the inevitable.
I offer no choice, for there is none.
Stop. Stop. Stop that! It tickles...
Humor... a frivolous ornament.

That you broke our alliance is unsurprising, Ambessa. Such are the winds of sentiment.

I have observed that a creation will always reject its creator.
I do what I must for our future.

You would have us remain insulated in our ignorance, professor.

We could have ushered in a new era together, Jayce.

Though we became enemies, Mel, your support will never be forgotten.

It seems perfection is still fallible, Orianna. I must think on this.

I am only the beginning.

Share in my vision!
The Arcane reaches all!
All will know Hextech!

As a child, I dreamt of becoming you, Singed. How foolish I was.
I used to enjoy such trinkets.
Humanity's toys.
Hextech endures!
Your people failed you,Vander.
Your people failed you,Vander.
How unnecessary.
You submitted to your baser instincts.
You lack the perspective to know your own destruction.
Annihilation over reason.
Unrealized to the end.
If only our minds had been united.
Why could you not learn from my example?
They fight against their own preservation...

All will prosper when my purpose is fulfilled. Let us proceed aspartners, Jayce.
Humanity has stumbled... but I will catch the fallen, and show them the glory of evolution.
A new era is here. Follow me, and I will give you enlightenment in place of emotion.
No longer will we be guided by invisible hands. TheArcanewill free us, and I am its herald.
I speak now with not one voice, but many. EmbraceHextech.
Hexcorization requires no justification. What purpose is there in explaining a horseshoe to the horse?
Mankind clings to its past. Glorifies its present. And lives in dread of tomorrow.
Machines are near perfect. I will make humanity even greater.
Emotion and logic cannot coexist. One must be shed to gain the other.
Governed by instinct, humans are no more than flawed and flailing animals.
I am the only one with the means to cure suffering. But it is a lonely path.
I chose to become this. Difficulty had no bearing nor did danger. It was... necessary.
They think humanity can survive with emotion? Survive as what? Creatures blinded by impulse?
What I am doing is not torment. Torment is allowing the mind to corrupt the soul.
Sentiment is incompatible with control.
The time for leniency has passed.
Passion double-crosses, subverts, divides.
This world will know magnificence.
Emotion... clashes with reason.
Perfection is within their reach...
All that is logical is true, absolute, irrefutable.
I did not know true...beauty, until the Arcane.
They mistake pragmatism for malice.
True change must be imposed, not offered.
I alone see what must be done.
To live with flaws, is to be subject to them.
We will supersede nature.
Without the Hexcore, death would have claimed me.
Humanity... is self-corrupting.
So much of what we value is inconsequential.
I won't forget the lives lost in my pursuit of excellence.
The Hexcore is humanity's transcendental catalyst.
All will soon change.
My comfort with death comes from proximity, not ignorance.
I am not the man I was, but who I wished to be.
Doubt has been purged from me.
The Arcane is the answer.
Hextech will unitePiltoverandZaunonce and for all.
No one need live with doubt anymore.
Perfected!
Unrivaled!
Indomitable!
Indomitable!
Unrivaled!

Transformation.
Order through chaos.
Behold the Arcane!
Sublime!
Evolution fast approaches.

Progress is not a straight line.
There are too many variables. I must reevaluate my calculations.
I see every possibility and outcome laid before me.
Dissonance distracts from purpose.
This conflict is best resolved by other means.
Evolution has stalled in my absence.
The secrets of the Arcane defy reality.
Why would I be brought back if not to enact change?
Where one possiblity ends, another begins.
I will not waste this life. Not for them, not for me.
Hextech's power bends the petty rules of life and death.
In another life, this would have seemed... impossible.
Death always brings new perspective.
There will be no need for shopkeepers after theGlorious Evolution.
I warn you... I evolve beyond these transactions.
Emotion... corrodes the soul. As does money.
I have no vanity to indulge.
Surprise me.
Hmm. A curious provocation.
