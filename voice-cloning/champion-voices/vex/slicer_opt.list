Vex_Original_FirstEncounterLucian.wav|vex|en|You know what, Viego? I liked your earlier stuff better.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterLux.wav|vex|en|I don't have to listen to you, Viego. You're not my real dad.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterSentinels.wav|vex|en|Ugh, Yasuo... I can already tell we are not gonna vibe.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterShadowIsles.wav|vex|en|Just keep walkin', yordle. I got nothin' to say to you.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterThreshSkin27.wav|vex|en|I'm not really a cat person. I'm more of a... nothing person.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterVeigar.wav|vex|en|So you're the reason I have to be here today?
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterViego_0.wav|vex|en|Let's make this easy. I'll wait here and you go die.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterViego_1.wav|vex|en|Just give up. I did.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterYasuo.wav|vex|en|We're all doomed, but you're more doomed.
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterYordles.wav|vex|en|Another person to kill. Shadow, can you handle it?
Vex_Original_FirstEncounterYuumi.wav|vex|en|Life sucks... but at least I'm not you.
Vex_Original_Joke.wav|vex|en|You'd like Bandle City. It sucks too.
Vex_Original_JokeResponse.wav|vex|en|Ahh, Viego... is okay. I mean, he's whatever... I guess.
Vex_Original_Kill_0.wav|vex|en|Don't care. Don't care. Don't care.
Vex_Original_Kill_1.wav|vex|en|Cool.
Vex_Original_Kill_2.wav|vex|en|Que foda! Digo... Tanto faz...

Vex_Original_Kill_5.wav|vex|en|Way to die, normie.
Vex_Original_Kill_6.wav|vex|en|You're lucky. Being a ghost is so cool.
Vex_Original_Kill_7.wav|vex|en|See ya never.
Vex_Original_Kill_8.wav|vex|en|You look better this way.

Vex_Original_Move_1.wav|vex|en|And then I told her, 'Get outta my room!' And she said, 'This is my house, young lady and'... Oh, hang on, Shadow. I'll finish this later.
Vex_Original_Move_2.wav|vex|en|Blegh, just got here: already over it.
Vex_Original_Move_3.wav|vex|en|Other people are here? Ugggh, great.
Vex_Original_Move_4.wav|vex|en|This is going to be... awful, in a very good way. A good, awful way. You know what I mean!
Vex_Original_Move_5.wav|vex|en|Hmm. What color should I wear today? Black? Or charcoal?
Vex_Original_Move_6.wav|vex|en|Before I met the Black Mist, I lived in a world of color and happiness. I was so lost.
Vex_Original_Move_7.wav|vex|en|Welcome to Sad Town. Population: Me. Everyone else get out.
Vex_Original_Move_8.wav|vex|en|Ugghhh, this is gonna take foreverrr. Why is everything so far?
Vex_Original_Move_9.wav|vex|en|Okay, Shadow. Wake me when we hit something.
Vex_Original_Move_10.wav|vex|en|I could start a club for people who hate people! Ehh, but no one would show up.
Vex_Original_Move_11.wav|vex|en|I am not cute. I am dark and forlorn and hopelessly morbid!
Vex_Original_Move_12.wav|vex|en|Why do I even wake up in the morning? Oh, right. To make people miserable.
Vex_Original_Move_13.wav|vex|en|I wouldn't say I ran away from home. More like... trudged. Yeeeah, trudged.
Vex_Original_Move_14.wav|vex|en|Shadow, I think I'm gonna start calling you... 'Scar'.
Vex_Original_Move_15.wav|vex|en|It is not a stupid name. 'Shadow' is a stupid name.
Vex_Original_Move_16.wav|vex|en|Let's turn these smiles upside down.
Vex_Original_Move_17.wav|vex|en|Ugh, can we get some rain clouds in here.
Vex_Original_Move_18.wav|vex|en|Okay... time to take it down a level.
Vex_Original_Move_19.wav|vex|en|Ugghh, Shadowwww, carry meeee.
Vex_Original_Move_20.wav|vex|en|Yeah. I wore this yesterday. What about it?
Vex_Original_Move_21.wav|vex|en|I could really use less friends.
Vex_Original_Move_22.wav|vex|en|Blegh. Sunlight.
Vex_Original_Move_23.wav|vex|en|Every silver lining has a dark cloud.
Vex_Original_Move_24.wav|vex|en|Man... walking suucks.
Vex_Original_Move_25.wav|vex|en|This place is so getting harrowed.
Vex_Original_Move_26.wav|vex|en|If I can't be happy, no one can.
Vex_Original_Move_27.wav|vex|en|Calm down, Shadow. I'm trying to sulk.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|vex|en|D'ughhh, look at that tree. So stupid.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|vex|en|I'm coming, I'm coming.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|vex|en|Death is the true meaning of life. Whoa! That's deep.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|vex|en|Wish my hood covered all my face.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|vex|en|Uggh, this place has way too many colors.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|vex|en|Stop copying me, Shadow.
Vex_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|vex|en|Guess I'll mope over here.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|vex|en|You know what, Shadow? Sometimes... I almost don't hate you.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|vex|en|This is as far as my eyes can roll.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|vex|en|Uggh... more of the same.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|vex|en|Yep. The glass is half empty.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|vex|en|It's not a phase and I won't grow out of it!
Vex_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|vex|en|I can feel it. Someone's happy over there.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|vex|en|Think sad thoughts. Think sad thoughts.
Vex_Original_MoveLong_7.wav|vex|en|I'll show them the meaning of apathy. Or not.
Vex_Original_P1_1.wav|vex|en|I'm only in this place cause I hate it.
Vex_Original_P1_2.wav|vex|en|Ugghh...
Vex_Original_P1_3.wav|vex|en|Whatever.
Vex_Original_P1_6.wav|vex|en|'Kay.
Vex_Original_P2_0.wav|vex|en|Ugh!
Vex_Original_P2_1.wav|vex|en|Lose the pep.
Vex_Original_P2_2.wav|vex|en|Bring it down a notch.
Vex_Original_P2_3.wav|vex|en|Seriously?
Vex_Original_P2_4.wav|vex|en|Don't even think about it.
Vex_Original_P2_5.wav|vex|en|I wouldn't do that.
Vex_Original_P2_6.wav|vex|en|Well look at you.
Vex_Original_R_0.wav|vex|en|Nnnnnnnope.
Vex_Original_R_1.wav|vex|en|Comin' in sad!
Vex_Original_R_2.wav|vex|en|Aaand this one.
Vex_Original_R2_0.wav|vex|en|Wheeeee.
Vex_Original_R2_1.wav|vex|en|Follow-up.
Vex_Original_R2_2.wav|vex|en|Super meh.
Vex_Original_R2_3.wav|vex|en|Do the thing, Shadow.
Vex_Original_R2_4.wav|vex|en|Feel what I feel.
Vex_Original_Recall_0.wav|vex|en|Meh!
Vex_Original_Recall_1.wav|vex|en|Shadow, can I get, like five minutes alone? 'Kay, fine.
Vex_Original_Recall_2.wav|vex|en|I am so over this place.
Vex_Original_Recall_3.wav|vex|en|Later.
Vex_Original_Recall_4.wav|vex|en|Oh. Where are we goin'? Y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Vex_Original_Recall_5.wav|vex|en|Finally... the part were I get to leave.
Vex_Original_Recall_6.wav|vex|en|If anyone needs me I'll be back... uhh, I-I dunno. Whenever.
Vex_Original_Respawn_0.wav|vex|en|Darkness, take me. Seriously. I'm burning up out here.
Vex_Original_Respawn_1.wav|vex|en|Time to get up already?
Vex_Original_Respawn_2.wav|vex|en|No, leave me alone. I'm sleeping...
Vex_Original_Respawn_3.wav|vex|en|Please... put me back in my misery...!
Vex_Original_Respawn_4.wav|vex|en|That... wasn't as cool as I thought it'd be.
Vex_Original_Respawn_5.wav|vex|en|Well that was some quality alone time.
Vex_Original_Respawn_6.wav|vex|en|Okay, I'm awake...Stop already!
Vex_Original_Respawn_7.wav|vex|en|I get to do it all again? Yaaay.
Vex_Original_Taunt.wav|vex|en|Oh, Shadow, just leave me.
Vex_Original_TauntResponse.wav|vex|en|Honestly, you taunt yourself just by being you.
Vex_Ban.wav|vex|en|Don't care. Don't care. Don't care.
Vex_Select.wav|vex|en|'Kay. See if I care.
