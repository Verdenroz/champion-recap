wavs/audio_0001.wav|They fear me. They should.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Blood is the price.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You'll answer to me.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Like men to the slaughter.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|It takes a monster to gut one.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|You hurt them, I hurt you.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You'll choke on your screams.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|You're the prey!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Less talking, more biting!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Bones to break.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|This pain is nothing.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is who I am.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You die next.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|It's not the beast you should be afraid of.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Not even your screams will escape.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Killing, I remember.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Overwatch
wavs/audio_0018.wav|If you die, how many live?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Blood brings rage.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|The killing stops when Zaun is free.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|A monster's inside you... I'll tear it out!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Give in to the beast.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Give in... the beast!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Pain... nothing!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Hero...die!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Watch you bleed!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|No screams!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Men... slaughter...
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Killing... remember!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Hurting you...
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Claws... hungry!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Blood's on me!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Nine tails to chase!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Zaun has enough shadows.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|There's more to kill in a plague rat. You're all machine.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|So deep in Piltover's pockets, I can only see your hat.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Blood, hextech and... (sniffs) tea.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Progress is just what Piltovans call murder.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I'll pick my teeth with your legs!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Rewind too far, and you'll be back in my teeth!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|The one person in Zaun who runs to the past.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|I'll show you pain!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|You were there...
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Let me forget...
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Which one of you is the wolf?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|From a roar to a scream!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You can't even kill an insect.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Zaun gave me claws long before you did.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Can't outrun your mistakes!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You're going to need more bandages!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I remember what you did!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Eat your heart out.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|There are more rats than men in Zaun.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|And I thought theChem-Baronswere vermin.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Which one of us is the monster?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Zaun needed you!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Who taught you how to punch?
wavs/audio_0058.wav|The fear in your eyes. I've seen it before.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Three arms... and no claws.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|First I'll kill you, and then I'll--- yordle!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Yordles. The alpha predator.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I don't know what you are, but I hope youbleed!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Zaun has enough shadows.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Scooby-Doo
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Scratch behind my ears...
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Who's a good boy? I am!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Meat!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|The chains are broken... the beast is free.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|The blood you spilledcallsto me.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I am in control.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Can't save you all... don't want to.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|All the blood you've spilled brought me here.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Zaun will fight back!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|You know what you've done.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The city is my hunting ground.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|This place is familiar...
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Run faster!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|The beast grows stronger.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Run... while you can.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I know Zaun's streets like the back of my claws.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I became the monster I always was.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The man I was... I killed him first.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Try to hide.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The memories come back every time you scream.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I can smell everything.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Vengeance is only a step behind you.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|You made the monster.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Zaun will watch you bleed, and it will do nothing.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|All... is anger!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|In... control...!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I became... monster!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Try... hide!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Broken...!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Fear me!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|What have you done!?
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Seeking... hunting...
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Blood spilled!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Run, faster!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Bite back!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Can't... save you...!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|If I don't kill you, Zaun will.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Back to killingChem-Barons.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|More scars—as if I didn't have enough.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I have your scent.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|You killed Warwick, but left the beast.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I almost felt that.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|One thing you should know: I honour my debts.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Violence can be death—or a way of life.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I ran these streets—now it's your turn to run.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Blood runs... they all run.
