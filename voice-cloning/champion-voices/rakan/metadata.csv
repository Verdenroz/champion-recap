wavs/audio_0065.wav|Learn to dance!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Man, that's insulting!

wavs/audio_0080.wav|Oh yeah!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Baby, I don't do safe!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Oh, this is all so intense!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|You can't tell me you weren't impressed!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Just generally! I'm amazing!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I can't die looking this good!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|After this, how about we get some human food?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Chocolate!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|We're eating chocolate!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Nope, but let's do it!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I have a cunning plan.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I think you intimidate human females.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|It's kinda hot!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Should I show them the dance?
wavs/audio_0095.wav|You thinking about me?
wavs/audio_0096.wav|That's very upsetting!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Try not to die?
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Rakan has arrived!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Yeah! That's what I like!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Can I start off?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Let's start it off!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I'm a humble entertainer!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Yeah, I'm the best.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Who is that gorgeous thing over there?
wavs/audio_0106.wav|It's always the time!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I'm handling it, dear.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I was, Iâ€” I will.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|How long do we fight?
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Is that after lunch?
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Uh... yes?
wavs/audio_0113.wav|How will we know if the plan works?
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I am not a piece of meat.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Caw caw, caw caw!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|No one can control me!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Ha! When don't I?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|If I vanish, what would you do?
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Am I good to you?
wavs/audio_0121.wav|I'm going rogue!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Be right back!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Who can know these things?
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I know.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|The fight's here!, by me!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Doing it!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Even me?
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Should we give them a fighting chance?
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Who do I hit?
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Ah.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Good times!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Be my guest, miella!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|You see that?
wavs/audio_0135.wav|They'll never forget.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Happily.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|You love it when I slap fools?
wavs/audio_0138.wav|This is the plan, right?
wavs/audio_0139.wav|What do you want to do later?
wavs/audio_0140.wav|You hungry?
wavs/audio_0141.wav|But... but... food!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Eyes on the prize, baby.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Let me at 'em!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I want to show 'em!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Do we need any of these fools?
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Can't! Punching!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|That was beautiful, baby!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|I have your back!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Too long.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|These guys look silly!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|How many fights we gotta win?
wavs/audio_0152.wav|That's my baby.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Did I do that?
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Who's counting?
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Miella, I helped, right?
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Every time you do that, it drives me crazy.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Were... they trying?
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I love watching you kill.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Let's make out.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Haha! Told you!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Did they deserve it?
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Why do they break so easily?
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Pity.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say,
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|They couldn't keep up with you.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Hey, Xayah.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|You sexy.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|That shouldn't be a problem.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|You okay?
wavs/audio_0171.wav|You're pushing yourself too hard.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Where are we going?
wavs/audio_0173.wav|No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Yeah?
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Well, try not to die then.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Darling?
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Pay attention to me.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Back there?
wavs/audio_0179.wav|I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|How can humans not hear the magic?
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Why?
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Thanks.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Not saying 'I told you so.'
wavs/audio_0184.wav|What was?
wavs/audio_0185.wav|You gonna marry me today?
wavs/audio_0186.wav|I always do.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Love is so cruel!
wavs/audio_0189.wav|What's after this?
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Hm. Good.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|It's gonna be okay.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Hey, I know that.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|You know I love you.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Did you notice the sky?
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Not as beautiful as you.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I am R-r-r-akan!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Hubba hubba.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|No! I want to!
wavs/audio_0200.wav|...nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|What are those things humans wear on their feet?
wavs/audio_0202.wav|I need shoes. Red ones. I need themsobad.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Did I tell you I love you?
wavs/audio_0204.wav|I love you.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Why do you never say yes?
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Can we just stay here?
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Aw...
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Xayah? I think we got a problem...
wavs/audio_0209.wav|I...knowwe got a problem?
wavs/audio_0210.wav|You gotta rest, honey.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Everyone can wait.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|What would you do if I died?
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Aw... that's sweet.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Okay. I'll get more.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Wherever our hearts desire.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|How do you like me today?
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Every day of my life.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|No. I'm the lucky one.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I'm fine with that.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|Vi-om kaash.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Baasi sur ma-vae!
wavs/audio_0222.wav|We won't get separated.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|No, I'm not! ... only a little.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|You are stunning and beautiful...
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|If anybody's gonna die first, it's gonna be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is aterriblecolor on me.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Alright, let's go! This way or that way?
wavs/audio_0228.wav|We have a plan?
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Huh. Really?
wavs/audio_0230.wav|I know what'll make you feel better...
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Hey, I have a plan.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Yeah! I'll go on instinct!
wavs/audio_0233.wav|You sure about this?
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Be safe.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|They always go wrong.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Mostly?
wavs/audio_0237.wav|That's why I'm here.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|So, this mission... are we, uh...?
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do.
wavs/audio_0240.wav|When are we going to do this?
wavs/audio_0241.wav|I ain't gonna kill you. She is!
wavs/audio_0242.wav|Kiss me, honey.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Give them a pretty last image.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|At what?
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Can we leave now?
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Not like this...
wavs/audio_0247.wav|Damn...
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Open... casket...
wavs/audio_0249.wav|I got you!
wavs/audio_0250.wav|You okay?
wavs/audio_0251.wav|I know you're Vastaya, but your tribe... lacks style!
wavs/audio_0252.wav|So, just tiger stuff? Buddy, you've got to mix it up.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|So, you just... run around in the jungle, huh? I mean, I'm not judging, if that's what you're into. Nerd.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Do you want to smell it?Not for you!
wavs/audio_0255.wav|You want to smell it?No flower for you!
wavs/audio_0256.wav|Girl thought she could pull out my soul. But I got too much soul!
wavs/audio_0257.wav|What was with that girl's dumb purse?
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Big girl had too much going on.
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Your kind started this war. We will end it.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|You put us in a cage? I put you in the ground!
wavs/audio_0261.wav|I don't want to like killing, but this time, I did.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|We don't want your harmony! We want our freedom!
wavs/audio_0263.wav|I showed you the dance. You should've moved.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Punk ass cape.
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Problem with that guy? No talent.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|He had some style... for a human.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|Fool thought he could upstageme?
wavs/audio_0268.wav|Was that a land shark? I mean, why? Why is that a thing?
wavs/audio_0269.wav|Six legs. Still couldn't dance.
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Perfect predator? I got an instinct about how stupid that thing was.
wavs/audio_0271.wav|You were given Vastayan blood, yet chose to be blind.
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Power was not meant to be contained. Now, it is free.
wavs/audio_0273.wav|Another. Dead. Poser.
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Kind of feel bad for the guy. His feathers were weak.
wavs/audio_0275.wav|Punk was trying too hard.
wavs/audio_0276.wav|It is from our blood your gifts came, and my hand that took it back.
wavs/audio_0277.wav|One animal at a time? Weak.
wavs/audio_0278.wav|Hello, world! I am single now!
wavs/audio_0279.wav|I bet she's gonna be angry about that later.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|I miss her already. Oh well.
wavs/audio_0281.wav|Well. I always was the pretty one.
wavs/audio_0282.wav|I find this parallel universe stuff very upsetting.
wavs/audio_0283.wav|You were a shadow without a flame.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|You thought you got away?
wavs/audio_0285.wav|I remembered your trespass.
wavs/audio_0286.wav|Messed with my girl. What did you think I was going to do?
wavs/audio_0287.wav|You came to visit us! Did you think we would forget?
wavs/audio_0288.wav|Whoops. Now you are dead.
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Party foul!
wavs/audio_0290.wav|Oh! Can't touch this!
wavs/audio_0291.wav|Got a feeling I shouldn't have done that.
wavs/audio_0292.wav|Woo! I feel good!
wavs/audio_0293.wav|Step up again, I'll slap you down again.
wavs/audio_0294.wav|Come on, fool thought he could match my style?
wavs/audio_0295.wav|Ugh. Sorry about that.
wavs/audio_0296.wav|I'm not about killing, but I'll put in the work.
wavs/audio_0297.wav|Also, your look is played out.
wavs/audio_0298.wav|I got the deadly fresh style!
wavs/audio_0299.wav|The dance is deadly.
wavs/audio_0300.wav|You see this cape? Ha! I say goddamnI'm sexy!
wavs/audio_0301.wav|Nothing important should be taken seriously.
wavs/audio_0302.wav|Okay, everybody, I'm here, I'm here... the party starts now!
wavs/audio_0303.wav|My fellow travelers, you are all about to witness my majestic epicness! ...unless I get killed, but... probably not!
wavs/audio_0304.wav|Xayah? Xayah? Crap. What was I supposed to do?
wavs/audio_0305.wav|Consequences only matter if I don't get away.
wavs/audio_0306.wav|Magic is in the heart. Magic is in the rhythm.
wavs/audio_0307.wav|I can't wait to get in there. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I am going toget in there!
wavs/audio_0308.wav|War is in the dance.
wavs/audio_0309.wav|Okay, Rakan, get 'em watching you, then you burn 'em up.
wavs/audio_0310.wav|The humans call it battle. It's just a dance.
wavs/audio_0311.wav|They will remember my name!
wavs/audio_0312.wav|Our magic is a fury. It is a song you cannot resist.
wavs/audio_0313.wav|It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth.
wavs/audio_0314.wav|Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear.
wavs/audio_0315.wav|Should I be... running? Yeah, I should... probably be running.
wavs/audio_0316.wav|It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party.
wavs/audio_0317.wav|Man, have you seen that forest over there?
wavs/audio_0318.wav|Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly... but you too!
wavs/audio_0319.wav|I don't do safe.
wavs/audio_0320.wav|I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny.
wavs/audio_0321.wav|Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second.
wavs/audio_0322.wav|Danger is as fun as you let it be.
wavs/audio_0323.wav|Magic is a wilderness.
wavs/audio_0324.wav|Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!
wavs/audio_0325.wav|They want us in cages. We refuse.
wavs/audio_0326.wav|You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it.
wavs/audio_0327.wav|The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song.
wavs/audio_0328.wav|I dance so fine I kill.
wavs/audio_0329.wav|Time to get it started!
wavs/audio_0330.wav|I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!
wavs/audio_0331.wav|I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music.
wavs/audio_0332.wav|I dance because I'm free!
wavs/audio_0333.wav|I'm going to take all they got, then laugh as I throw it away.
wavs/audio_0334.wav|I got my look right, I got my moves right... time to show it!
wavs/audio_0335.wav|I will walk in. I will dance. They will party.
wavs/audio_0336.wav|If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party.
wavs/audio_0337.wav|Don't leave nothing! Bring it all!
wavs/audio_0338.wav|I don't want a war, but I want to be free.
wavs/audio_0339.wav|I dance because I'm free.
wavs/audio_0340.wav|I'm getting impatient.
wavs/audio_0341.wav|They think they can catch me.
wavs/audio_0342.wav|Humans made promises. More than I can remember. They kept none.
wavs/audio_0343.wav|They will see me. They will see my dance!
wavs/audio_0344.wav|I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?
wavs/audio_0345.wav|This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise.
wavs/audio_0346.wav|What human's call magic, we call life.
wavs/audio_0347.wav|The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it and join the dance
wavs/audio_0348.wav|I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!
wavs/audio_0349.wav|For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air.
wavs/audio_0350.wav|I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I'd die for. That's who I am.
wavs/audio_0351.wav|I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?
wavs/audio_0352.wav|I can't wait to see what I'm going to do.
wavs/audio_0353.wav|I don't need to understand the plan! I trust my love.
wavs/audio_0354.wav|Magic isn't supposed to be safe.
wavs/audio_0355.wav|They're scared of darkness. They're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from.
wavs/audio_0356.wav|Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here.
wavs/audio_0357.wav|I'm just trying to live the moment.
wavs/audio_0358.wav|It's a revolution. And it's good times.
wavs/audio_0359.wav|They ain't ready for what I'm bringing!
wavs/audio_0360.wav|I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone.

wavs/audio_0362.wav|I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music.
wavs/audio_0363.wav|I'm gonna burn this place down, then help them build it back up... so I can burn it again!
wavs/audio_0364.wav|Ain't nothing I say should be taken seriously! That's why it's the truth!
wavs/audio_0365.wav|Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies.
wavs/audio_0366.wav|Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain.
wavs/audio_0367.wav|Fun. I need some fun. Now!
wavs/audio_0368.wav|They will see my dance, then they will know magic's joy... and its fury.
wavs/audio_0369.wav|Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna heal them.
wavs/audio_0370.wav|I don't want a world that's safe.
wavs/audio_0371.wav|Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse.
wavs/audio_0372.wav|I am only as wild as magic.
wavs/audio_0373.wav|They're gonna try and testme? Haha!
wavs/audio_0374.wav|Humans think that to believe in something, you have to be serious about it. That's their problem.
wavs/audio_0375.wav|Crayon
wavs/audio_0376.wav|There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see.
wavs/audio_0377.wav|If Xayah says someone has to die, they die. And they deserved it.
wavs/audio_0378.wav|They've never seen moves like mine.
wavs/audio_0379.wav|I'm gonna live forever!
wavs/audio_0380.wav|Stayin' Alive
wavs/audio_0381.wav|Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves.
wavs/audio_0382.wav|It's all filthy and dangerous. And that's why I love it!
wavs/audio_0383.wav|I can't die looking this good!
wavs/audio_0384.wav|Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future.
wavs/audio_0385.wav|I look good, I feel good, let's kick some ass!
wavs/audio_0386.wav|I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously! Rude!
wavs/audio_0387.wav|I don't need anything, but the right now.
wavs/audio_0388.wav|The universe loves me.
wavs/audio_0389.wav|I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations.
wavs/audio_0390.wav|I am a chronic line-stepper.
wavs/audio_0391.wav|They ain't seen moves like mine.
wavs/audio_0392.wav|Ah... I miss Xayah.
wavs/audio_0393.wav|Woo! I am so into this! What is this?
wavs/audio_0394.wav|Why is it taking so long to get back to the action?
wavs/audio_0395.wav|I will make them dance. I will make them hear.
wavs/audio_0396.wav|I'm offended by how little attention I was given.
wavs/audio_0397.wav|If you aren't a little frightened, you ain't alive.
wavs/audio_0398.wav|Somebody?
wavs/audio_0399.wav|Oh no, oh no!
wavs/audio_0400.wav|Oh, hell nope!
wavs/audio_0401.wav|Help!
wavs/audio_0402.wav|This is bad!
wavs/audio_0403.wav|I don't like this!
wavs/audio_0404.wav|SOS!
wavs/audio_0405.wav|Oh crap, oh crap!
wavs/audio_0406.wav|Danger zone!
wavs/audio_0407.wav|Yipes!
wavs/audio_0408.wav|Careful!
wavs/audio_0409.wav|Not good!
wavs/audio_0410.wav|Something here!
wavs/audio_0411.wav|Spooky!
wavs/audio_0412.wav|Danger!
wavs/audio_0413.wav|Watch it!
wavs/audio_0414.wav|That ain't good!
wavs/audio_0415.wav|Beware!
wavs/audio_0416.wav|Be safe!
wavs/audio_0417.wav|Look out!
wavs/audio_0418.wav|Where are they?
wavs/audio_0419.wav|Mysterious mystery!
wavs/audio_0420.wav|What's happening?
wavs/audio_0421.wav|They ain't here.
wavs/audio_0422.wav|Heads up!
wavs/audio_0423.wav|Where'd they go?
wavs/audio_0424.wav|Nobody's here.
wavs/audio_0425.wav|They gone?
wavs/audio_0426.wav|What's going on?
wavs/audio_0427.wav|They missing?
wavs/audio_0428.wav|Bringing the fun!
wavs/audio_0429.wav|I'mma coming, I'mma coming!
wavs/audio_0430.wav|On the way!
wavs/audio_0431.wav|Heading over!
wavs/audio_0432.wav|Bringing the show!
wavs/audio_0433.wav|There in a sec!
wavs/audio_0434.wav|Running over!
wavs/audio_0435.wav|On my way!
wavs/audio_0436.wav|Here I come!
wavs/audio_0437.wav|Coming, love!
wavs/audio_0438.wav|Party starter!
wavs/audio_0439.wav|This is the drop!
wavs/audio_0440.wav|Oh! Yeah!
wavs/audio_0441.wav|Can't stop me!
wavs/audio_0442.wav|P.T.
wavs/audio_0443.wav|You gotta keep up, baby!
wavs/audio_0444.wav|Better hurry up!
wavs/audio_0445.wav|Rakan out.
wavs/audio_0446.wav|Wanna catch a ride?
wavs/audio_0447.wav|Coming?
wavs/audio_0448.wav|Is... 'totally bogus' your thing?
wavs/audio_0449.wav|Hey, I'm right here. So, can you be less uptight and lame now?
wavs/audio_0450.wav|You know, I ain't really about making fun of people, but you... make that difficult.
wavs/audio_0451.wav|Can we just get started already?
wavs/audio_0452.wav|Why are you so boring?
wavs/audio_0453.wav|Man, are you digging this air?
wavs/audio_0454.wav|I got three rules. You're breaking two of them with that outfit.
wavs/audio_0455.wav|There's this thing called grooming. You should try it.
wavs/audio_0456.wav|So, when you got dressed this morning, was this the look you were going for?
wavs/audio_0457.wav|Oh, you're bumming me out.
wavs/audio_0458.wav|I'll just put that there. That's a good place. I hope. Yeah...
wavs/audio_0459.wav|Vision is the first step towards understanding.
wavs/audio_0460.wav|I am not blind to any possibility.
wavs/audio_0461.wav|When you open your eyes, you see everything is limitless.
wavs/audio_0462.wav|Aw, crap, I hate having to have a plan.
wavs/audio_0463.wav|Our kind will see the truth soon enough.
wavs/audio_0464.wav|The world's a big place. Don't want to miss any of it.
wavs/audio_0465.wav|Turn in, turn on, drop out.
wavs/audio_0466.wav|I should totally get paid for this.
wavs/audio_0467.wav|The sleeper must awaken.
wavs/audio_0468.wav|I dig seeing stuff.
wavs/audio_0469.wav|Peekaboo.
wavs/audio_0470.wav|I know people are watching. How could they not be?
wavs/audio_0471.wav|I need to see if people can see how awesome I am!
wavs/audio_0472.wav|I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to scout around. Pretty, pretty sure.
wavs/audio_0473.wav|I'm going to show people some of the strange.
wavs/audio_0474.wav|Mankind is blind. I want them to see.
wavs/audio_0475.wav|I think Xayah told me to improvise. At least, that's the only part of the plan I remember.
wavs/audio_0476.wav|Yep, if I'm going to see the human world I need to start.
wavs/audio_0477.wav|Well I don't want to miss the start of the party.
wavs/audio_0478.wav|If you look at things the right way, it's awesome.
wavs/audio_0479.wav|Let's see what's happening now.
wavs/audio_0480.wav|Hello? Anybody there?
wavs/audio_0481.wav|Every road leads someplace.
wavs/audio_0482.wav|The world isn't about collecting stuff, it's about seeing stuff.
wavs/audio_0483.wav|I need to know when the action's coming.
wavs/audio_0484.wav|I want to feel everything. That's the only way to live.
wavs/audio_0485.wav|Let's see what these animals can do.
wavs/audio_0486.wav|I live in the moment.
wavs/audio_0487.wav|Rakan, doing his job.
wavs/audio_0488.wav|I... totally forgot why I'm here.
wavs/audio_0489.wav|Come on!
wavs/audio_0490.wav|Come on!
wavs/audio_0491.wav|Come on!
wavs/audio_0492.wav|Sho!
wavs/audio_0493.wav|Sho!
wavs/audio_0494.wav|Sho!
