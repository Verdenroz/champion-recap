wavs/audio_0040.wav|You know what, Viego? I liked your earlier stuff better.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I don't have to listen to you, Viego. You're not my real dad.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Ugh, Yasuo... I can already tell we are not gonna vibe.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Just keep walkin', yordle. I got nothin' to say to you.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I'm not really a cat person. I'm more of a... nothing person.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|So you're the reason I have to be here today?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Let's make this easy. I'll wait here and you go die.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Just give up. I did.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|We're all doomed, but you're more doomed.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Another person to kill. Shadow, can you handle it?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Life sucks... but at least I'm not you.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|You'd like Bandle City. It sucks too.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Ahh, Viego... is okay. I mean, he's whatever... I guess.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Don't care. Don't care. Don't care.

wavs/audio_0066.wav|Blegh, just got here: already over it.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Other people are here? Ugggh, great.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|This is going to be... awful, in a very good way. A good, awful way. You know what I mean!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Hmm. What color should I wear today? Black? Or charcoal?
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Before I met the Black Mist, I lived in a world of color and happiness. I was so lost.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Welcome to Sad Town. Population: Me. Everyone else get out.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Ugghhh, this is gonna take foreverrr. Why is everything so far?
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Okay, Shadow. Wake me when we hit something.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I could start a club for people who hate people! Ehh, but no one would show up.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I am not cute. I am dark and forlorn and hopelessly morbid!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Why do I even wake up in the morning? Oh, right. To make people miserable.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I wouldn't say I ran away from home. More like... trudged. Yeeeah, trudged.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Shadow, I think I'm gonna start calling you... 'Scar'.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|It is not a stupid name. 'Shadow' is a stupid name.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Let's turn these smiles upside down.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Ugh, can we get some rain clouds in here.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Okay... time to take it down a level.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Ugghh, Shadowwww, carry meeee.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Yeah. I wore this yesterday. What about it?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I could really use less friends.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Blegh. Sunlight.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Every silver lining has a dark cloud.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Man... walking suucks.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|This place is so getting harrowed.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|If I can't be happy, no one can.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Calm down, Shadow. I'm trying to sulk.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|D'ughhh, look at that tree. So stupid.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I'm coming, I'm coming.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Death is the true meaning of life. Whoa! That's deep.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Wish my hood covered all my face.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Uggh, this place has way too many colors.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Stop copying me, Shadow.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Guess I'll mope over here.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|You know what, Shadow? Sometimes... I almost don't hate you.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|This is as far as my eyes can roll.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Uggh... more of the same.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Yep. The glass is half empty.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|It's not a phase and I won't grow out of it!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I can feel it. Someone's happy over there.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Think sad thoughts. Think sad thoughts.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I'll show them the meaning of apathy. Or not.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I'm only in this place cause I hate it.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Ugghh...
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Whatever.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|'Kay.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Ugh!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Lose the pep.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Bring it down a notch.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Seriously?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Don't even think about it.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I wouldn't do that.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Well look at you.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Nnnnnnnope.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Comin' in sad!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Aaand this one.

wavs/audio_0123.wav|Super meh.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Do the thing, Shadow.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Feel what I feel.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Meh!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Shadow, can I get, like five minutes alone? 'Kay, fine.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I am so over this place.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Later.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Oh. Where are we goin'? Y'know what? It doesn't matter.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Finally... the part were I get to leave.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|If anyone needs me I'll be back... uhh, I-I dunno. Whenever.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Darkness, take me. Seriously. I'm burning up out here.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Time to get up already?
wavs/audio_0135.wav|No, leave me alone. I'm sleeping...
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Please... put me back in my misery...!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|That... wasn't as cool as I thought it'd be.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Well that was some quality alone time.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Okay, I'm awake...Stop already!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I get to do it all again? Yaaay.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Oh, Shadow, just leave me.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Honestly, you taunt yourself just by being you.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Don't care. Don't care. Don't care.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|'Kay. See if I care.
