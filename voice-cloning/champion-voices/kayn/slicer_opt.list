Kayn_Original_Assassin_KillKillingSpree_0.wav|kayn|en|The more they send, the more they will bury.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_KillKillingSpree_1.wav|kayn|en|Your stance was weak, your tactics elementary and your execution sluggish.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_KillKillingSpree_2.wav|kayn|en|Shadows and the blade proved too much.

Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_14.wav|kayn|en|This is as it was meant to be.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_15.wav|kayn|en|I bested the darkin, now the plan continues.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_16.wav|kayn|en|I was forged by the uncaring providence of war.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_2.wav|kayn|en|Zed now walks in my shadow.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_3.wav|kayn|en|The reaping begins with purpose.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_4.wav|kayn|en|Light offers no sanctuary.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Move_5.wav|kayn|en|Bathing my enemies in shadow, I leave the light to the opressed.

Kayn_Original_Assassin_Respawn_1.wav|kayn|en|That was not the plan.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_Respawn_2.wav|kayn|en|A lucky stab in the dark.
Kayn_Original_Assassin_TauntAllyZed_0.wav|kayn|en|They will never see us coming.

Kayn_Original_Attack_4.wav|kayn|en|The blade bends to you!
Kayn_Original_Attack_5.wav|kayn|en|Cowering in the light... how foolish!

Kayn_Original_Attack_7.wav|kayn|en|Every slaughter has humble beginnings.
Kayn_Original_Attack_8.wav|kayn|en|They are worthy?
Kayn_Original_Attack_9.wav|kayn|en|Drive me into their flesh!
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_0.wav|kayn|en|Good choice. Pairs nicely with wrath and fury.
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_1.wav|kayn|en|Well, you know what you want...
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_2.wav|kayn|en|Aren't I enough?
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_3.wav|kayn|en|You're making me jealous.
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_4.wav|kayn|en|This will very much upset the balance.
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_5.wav|kayn|en|Not my first choice, but okay.
Kayn_Original_BuyItem_6.wav|kayn|en|A match made in shadow.
Kayn_Original_DestroyItemWard_0.wav|kayn|en|These trinkets only annoy me.

Kayn_Original_Move_21.wav|kayn|en|Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?
Kayn_Original_Move_22.wav|kayn|en|I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows.
Kayn_Original_Move_23.wav|kayn|en|I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!
Kayn_Original_Move_24.wav|kayn|en|I let you go and you will die.
Kayn_Original_Move_25.wav|kayn|en|The focused blade cuts deepest.
Kayn_Original_Move_26.wav|kayn|en|I have mastered every weapon of war. No prattling tool will prove an exception.
Kayn_Original_Move_27.wav|kayn|en|Such an obsequious pupil. I will be your new master.
Kayn_Original_Move_28.wav|kayn|en|You are not worthy of the power you hold.
Kayn_Original_Move_3.wav|kayn|en|I see your nightmares. Do they trouble you?
Kayn_Original_Move_4.wav|kayn|en|Their screams thrill me.

Kayn_Original_Move_6.wav|kayn|en|What will be the final lesson?
Kayn_Original_Move_7.wav|kayn|en|Whom should I obey? Master Zed, or the farm implement with delusions of grandeur?
Kayn_Original_Move_8.wav|kayn|en|Their screams will echo in this place.
Kayn_Original_Move_9.wav|kayn|en|There is much darkness around you... in you.

Kayn_Original_Slayer_Kill_1.wav|kayn|en|No one mourns you!
Kayn_Original_Slayer_Kill_10.wav|kayn|en|Your failure mocks this world.
Kayn_Original_Slayer_Kill_11.wav|kayn|en|That was some good murdering!

Kayn_Original_Slayer_Kill_6.wav|kayn|en|Pitiful. They send only fools!

Kayn_Original_Slayer_Recall_0.wav|kayn|en|I already miss killing!
Kayn_Original_Slayer_Recall_1.wav|kayn|en|I'd rather be unleashing wrath.
