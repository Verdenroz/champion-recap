Condemned to darkness, where our power grows.
Stone and spirit return to you.
Believe, Aphelios.
You have bled, so they will.
Soul and skill converge.
By light, the moon speaks!
A reckoning in stone.
They orbit their end.
Night embrace you!
I send you… light.
Weapons aimed by destiny.
It ends in silence.
The power of your belief.
For every phase, a weapon.
Carry the faith with you.
In your hand. From my heart.
No thought moves your hand.
We hide no longer.
Born of night.
Every movement, a ceremony.
Reach out, Aphelios.
Until night is everything.
Your fight echoes even here.
Blessings of the moon.
This will be your voice.
You are the moon's eclipse.
Through sacrifice, all things.
An omen in your grasp.
Phel… I'm sorry.
I'll find you. I promise...
No... I was supposed to help you! I knew…
To become a vessel for the heavens, one only needs faith.
The greatest power is the power greater than ourselves.
The aspect of the moon. What is she fleeing? What has she done?
Our aspect has returned… bringing darkness.
Diana knows the moon's name, Aphelios. I can feel it on her heart.
What do they hold if they only reach for the trigger?
We were born to twin destinies, to tragedy, as the sisters were before us.
The moon is with us in darkness, but it is not there for us.
Senna, in darkness, we find each other.
The Solari do not see: we shine brightest with another's light.
Soraka knows our pain, yet tells us not to feel it. To deny ourselves.
Yuumi is much friendlier when she visits me in the spirit realm, snuggling at my feet while I read Book and imagine the rain.
We have no enemies, Aphelios. Only those fated to meet us in the night.
Our faith will be tested.
Not even she knew what she would do. That was why she was afraid.
Mother moon, guide them.
The heavens turn toward darkness. Now is our time.
They are motes of dust, shimmering in moonlight.
A prayer for their souls. Torn from the night.
When you shine, the moon can worship. You did well, Aphelios.
To make a life of death… you do what you have to, brother.
Hah.
Hah.
Only one of us is safe.
You will not suffer in silence.
We bleed when we cannot cry.
Blood upon still lips.
Phel, you're hurt.
Be careful, Phel.
With every step, two steps. With every breath, two breaths.
Even from across the celestial veil… I will be with you, brother.
It always starts with pain. We can only do this together, Aphelios.
Your life upon the altar, brother… I will not betray it.
Aphelios… I hear you. I know what you sacrifice.
The pain makes you numb. But I can still feel, brother. I know the truth that pain hides.
You cannot feel the tear running down your cheek. I cannot wipe it away…
I see further through the celestial veil. What we call truth is shadow.
You make yourself a weapon, so you do not have to feel. But you are not a weapon; you are my brother.
You will make death more than death, brother. You will make it holy.
If pain is what awaits us in the darkness, brother… we must run to it, unafraid.
It is as the moon revealed, Aphelios. As beautiful. As terrifying.
Even when the moon is new, it is there. A whisper to the shadows of your soul… I am with you.
The fortress looms around me. It is everything. It is the only thing.
Phel… You have made every movement a thousand times. Until you bleed. Until you do not have to think.
We cannot touch the moon. But its light can touch us. Shouldn't that be enough? Light, on our fingers…
The Solari call us heretics, but when darkness comes, brother, they will need our light.
Our path is set between the last breaths taken by our enemies.
What we want, what we need, what we must do… I envy the ignorant.
The fortress is quiet. If only you could be here, Phel. You would make this stone seem loud.
Without pain, we would not need faith. The moon would not need us. We would not need each other, Aphelios.
Our thoughts touch… impossibly close. Which of us am I?
Find your orbit, brother.
Again and again, I see you reach… for me.
Our destiny is hidden in the night.
How can I help you when I put your life at risk?
I am right. This is what the moon tells me.
You are the weapon the Lunari need.
All we ask is for a witness to our sorrow.
Even when I close my eyes… I'll never look away.
Remember what you have learned, brother.
I'm never further than a whisper echoing in silence.
Beneath the mask of silence… I know your true face, brother.
Do not look back, Aphelios.
I am with you… shining above.
We're in this together. Darkness and light.
The moon shines brightest in darkness.
From our fortress, I will guide you. I promise.
As light reveals our path, so will darkness.
Each of us, an offering.
We must find each other before every first light.
I am your sister. I am listening.
Walk where I cannot.
The brighter my light, the stronger your shadow.
I beseech the moon to protect you.
You walk the path of darkness, but you do not walk it alone, brother.
You are not alone. Remember our promise.
The dawn will know the night's silence.
We walk through violence. Born of shadow. Born of light.
Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all.
We cannot let fear trap us in twilight.
Through your eyes, I see such wonders…
When your steps falter, brother, follow my voice.
You knew this would not be easy, the way forward written in scars.
By my word, you walk into the night.
The full moon reveals.
I will extend your reach, brother.
Moonlight will guide your aim.
Calibrum.
Death, arcing from your hand.
An orbit of blades.
The half moon, perfectly balanced.
Crescendum.
A new moon. The same darkness.
They will not escape what is coming.
Gravitum.
Darkness will weigh upon them.
Their steps will falter in darkness.
Cosmic flame will fill the night.
The moon grows in flame.
Infernum.
Enlighten the many.
Harvest death for life.
Severum.
The moon gathers darkness on the crescent's edge.
With every slash, resurrection.
I am with you.
I am with you!
Out of darkness, the moon is born anew.
I will not let you die.
Faith, brother.
As darkness falls, the moon rises.
So many weapons, Aphelios. The deadliest is your faith.
