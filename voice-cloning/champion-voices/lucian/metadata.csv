wavs/audio_0001.wav|You don't have the heart for this.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I've faced worse.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Don't duck on my account.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Yeah, I got a cure for that.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Plenty for all.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Two in the head.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Time to put you down.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Here comes target practice.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|I don't do warning shots.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|How you see this goin'?
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Both guns blazin'.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Have some peace.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Ready for the beyond?
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Sorry I gotta do this.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Got a death wish?
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Demonspawn!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Always primed.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Aimin' at you.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Nothin' left but the end.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Gonna need more coffins.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Hope you brought your sidearm.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Eat light.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Thisismercy.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Unclean.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Nothin's pure anymore.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Draw.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Move aside, friend.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Go on, scare me.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Try your luck.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Light 'em up.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Come get some.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I failed...
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I'll... wait for her...
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Senna...
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Purity... and... peace...
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Cleanse... me...
wavs/audio_0037.wav|How's Demacia? All safe from the Mist? Yeah. You're welcome.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Hey, big fella! Try drinkin' fromthesebarrels.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Need me to wait while you reload that thing?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Hey, gunslinger. I'll let you know if you hit somethin'.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|You pointin' that peashooter at me? Let's dance.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|A man can gettooclose to his horse, y'know.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|I ain't scared'a you, Hecarim. I just hate to put a good horse down.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Hey, pony man! You the one that left that pile over there?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Nothin' I like more than a horse that ain't been broken.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Fortune. 'Fraid I can't help you outta thisHarrowing.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Let's crack you open, Mordekaiser, and see what's inside.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Senna?! Ah, hell. If I'm gonna be shot, I'm glad it's by you.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|There she goes, the love of my life.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Looks like we got ourselves a lovers' quarrel. Happy shootin', Senna.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|That you, Senna? Uh... is this about me not makin' the bed again?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Lookin' for Thresh. You a friend of his?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|If you don't have a heartbeat, you'd best not be movin'.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Whoever made you forgot to turn off the ugly.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Thresh. You're mine.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Got a little somethin' for that lantern: two barrels of righteous fury.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I haven't forgotten you, Thresh, and I sure as hell ain't forgivin'.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|'Chain Warden.' Mighty tall name for a sack of bones.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Well, well. If it ain't the ugly low-down corpse that took my Senna.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Someday we'll hunt monsters together, Vayne. But today, we'll hunt each other.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I ain't the monster you're lookin' for, Vayne, but I reckon Icanbe.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|The Mist has you in a bad way, friend. Let me help.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|You one'a them? Better kill ya to be safe.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|One of us finds peace. One of us walks away.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|I got two good reasons for you to turn back.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Two guns, one you. Ain't likin' your odds.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Came to kill some ghouls. Guess you'll do.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Nothin' between you and me but gunlight.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I'm just full of salvation. Come get it, friend.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Thanks.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|And they say I have a grim sense of humor.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Thisismy happy face... see?
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Smile? ...Alright.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|No, really... Iamsmiling.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Yep. Reckon that's pure enough.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|For the light.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Look at us making new memories.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Sometimes, I see what the darkness is afraid of...
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Trust me, you're better off.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Rise again, I dare you.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Bullseyes.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|You best stay down!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|They never get tired of dyin'.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|You been kinda... distant since you came outta that lantern. Somethin' you ain't telling me?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|How do you aim that thing? Isn't it heavy?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|So what was it like? All that time in the lantern?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Reckon it's time-
wavs/audio_0088.wav|TheMistawaits us all. Say goodbye to whatever you care about.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I got two guns. One's for what's in front of me, and one's for what's chasin'.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Ain't enough bullets in the world for all the killin' I'm about to do.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Look at 'em all. Not even knowin' they're following me to hell.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Fight's this way. If you're coming along, try not to die.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|If I believed in something, I'd start prayin' to it right about now.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|There's a right side and a wrong side to these guns. Don't wanna be on the wrong side.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Happiness is for other folks. Best I can hope for... is peace.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Huh. Strange place. Beats the hell out of theShadow Isles, though.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|No place for feelings in this line of work. A full heart's an easy target.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|So my wife is half dead. Not a problem. I'll just... love the half that isn't.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I'll sleep when they're good and dead.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Not too many problems a shot to the head can't fix.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Always save one shot for myself... just in case.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|It's not the wraiths that haunt me, it's what could've been.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|How do you kill what's already dead? With a fistful of gunlight.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Life... phew... it's a hell of a thing.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|One shot for the years we lost, one for the love we can't get back.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Home is where I fight the dead.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|When I kill 'em, they stay killed.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Don't need triggers, just need a target.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|If you can't run from it, you might as well shoot it.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Some call it magic, I call it good aim.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Keep your guns out, and you'll never need to draw.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I can save her...I can save her...
wavs/audio_0113.wav|People never really change... I need to believe that.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Sentinel. Fancy word for someone with nothing to lose.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|You stare into the Mist, and the Mist stares back.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I've missed the smell of life.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|It ain't the grave I fear... it's what crawls out of it.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I've always fought the Black Mist... never thought I'd be married to it.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Bravest thing I ever did, was getting up this morning.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|What we had... can still be. I know it.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|These guns run on fury. I never run out.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|No sunshine where I'm going.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|My wife's eyes glow with spectral magic... I'm sure it's fine.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Now when I hold her, she feels... cold.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|This ain't war. Wars end.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Nothing as painful as seeing something good... go bad.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Spend this long around lost souls, and you're bound to lose your own.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|If I'm going down, I'm taking all those bastards with me.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Used to think nothing was colder than death, now I know different.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|How are you supposed to grieve... when the thing you mourn comes back?
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Everyone I shoot is her captor. Everyone I save is her.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Somethin' seems too good to be true? Probably is.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Whatever's in the beyond... I hope it's better than this.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I try to remember her the way she was... maybe it's best I don't.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Seen so much death I don't even notice it anymore.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|You can cleanse anything... if you have the right ammunition.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|For Senna!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Cleanse in fury!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|It ends here!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Ashes and dust!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Reckon I could use a rest, and a break from all the screamin'.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|A Sentinel's gotta know when to let his guns cool.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Sometimes the smart thing to do is walk the hell away.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Time to make like a wraith, and disappear.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Right about now, I could use some purifyin' of my own.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|It ain't ever a sin to be careful.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Can't run from trouble... sure can delay it for a spell though.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|The shot that doesn't kill ya, sure makes you mad as hell.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|The Mist won't take me yet.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Looks like no peace for me today.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Saw the beyond. Didn't like it much.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|I ain't got time to die.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Oh, someone's gonna pay for that.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I'll have no trouble killing you, and less trouble killing you again.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|We'll see how smart that mouth is when theHarrowingcomes.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Tough talk for worm food.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Getting used to it.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Could see how that would be preferable.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Really?
wavs/audio_0160.wav|What's to say? You're still cursed.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Well... reckon I shoot something twice, and then you shoot it a third time.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Oh. Ha, ha.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|'Cause I tried to... ohhhhh.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I aim to purify.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Try to be less beautiful.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Right. I'll keep up.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Everybody dies. Some just need a little help.
