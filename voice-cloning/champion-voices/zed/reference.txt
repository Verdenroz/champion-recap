Do not deny me.
Ignorance is fatal.
Cut the last breath from them.
I am the blade in the darkness.
They follow the wrong master.
The shadow is within.
Do not deny me.
None escape their shadow.
Punish restraint.
Only the worthy will survive.
Challenge me, Shen... you shall not be an orphan long!
The truth lies in darkness.
Balance is weakness.
Balance is a fool's master.
No technique is forbidden.
Do not fear the shrouded path.
Tradition is the corpse of wisdom.
Embrace the shadow... or die in darkness!
The merest shade of me... is enough to defeat you!
The unseen blade is the deadliest.
