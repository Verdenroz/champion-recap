Impure fools.
I release them from their pain.
I bring swift death.
I pass judgment.
Cleansing blood with silver.
They will be purified.
Joke? What do you mean?
I have no time for nonsense.
Purge with silver.
Silver of the moon.
The purifying element.
I smell black magics.
Evil lurks around every corner.
In the dark, all is laid bare.
The shadows are to be feared.
The dark should fear me.
I hear the innocent cry out.
Beware.
Impure fools...
Time for reckoning...
ἀνερρίφθω κύβος
Hitting me is like boxing with shadows!
Let us hunt those who have fallen to darkness.
