wavs/audio_0001.wav|Art can shed light on our fears.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Jhin, that was…beautiful.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You shape what I make!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Highlights and shadows!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Steady your hand!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Form the outline!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Be my canvas!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Your true colors!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Give me your full attention!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Watch closely!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Outside the lines!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Part of the whole picture!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Express everything!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Please focus!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|No…! Everything's… fading…
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Please… I'm still so lost…
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Don't… leave me alone… again…
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Change your view!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Look to the past!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Face your fears!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Open your eyes.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Keep still.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Stay.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Revealed.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|I have you.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Something still grieves in you, Ahri. White, like clouds and ice.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Shrouded in twilight hues. Will you rise again, or set for good, Akali?
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Ionians know the contrast between light and dark! Where doyoufall?
wavs/audio_0029.wav|We turned art into weapons, Irelia… What would our families think…?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Jhin. You opened my eyes to so much. I won't spare you fromanyof it.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|The spirit of Ionia can't guide me, Karma. I need to follow my own light…!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Kayn—blue and red bleed from you!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|The eyes do reveal you, Kennen: wild and wise.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Lee Sin, this piece will reach your spirit.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|We've seen ashes fill the sky, Yi. I wish we could leave those grey mornings behind.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Let me into your circle, Sett. You have information Ineed.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Shen, you've grown blind to sorrow, to joy… to life.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Sona, your music is your voice. Speak with me!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I know your power, Syndra. The depths of your hurt andrage.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Misery loves company, doesn't it, little one…
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Guilt covers us layer by layer, Yasuo.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|We carry our burdens with us, Yone: my mind, your mask.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|We have a lot in common, Zed. Step out of the shadows and see for yourself.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Let me recreate what you're afraid to confront!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Don't deny what I have to show you!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Keep an open mind, and we'll find meaning together.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Show me who you are, what you're capable of! I'll do the same.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Hmph. That's funny.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You don't need to grieve anymore, Ahri.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|From twilight to dusk, Akali.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|The first mark sets the tone.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Close your eyes, Jhin. Lie by the fireyoustarted.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Kayn… if you just allowed your selves to blend!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Rest, Yi. You're with your people again.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Art, life, death…!AllI've seen,allmade clear!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|We're struck by what finds us alone.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Consumed by the storm, inside and out.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You can't weather the pain on your own.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Live fully in the next life, Shen.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Zed—now we are both alone in our shadows.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Paint fades. Life fades.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I'll create something beautiful in your memory.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I drew the line—you crossed it.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|All I imagined… and it still came down to this.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|I…
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Leave everything to my imagination.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|None of us will leave unchanged. I'll make sense of our suffering.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|There's no secret to art… just begin and keep going. That's all we can do.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Every question, every burden, every vision: I'll lay them out, here.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Life has to be valued, no seconds wasted… Time is ripped away too quickly.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|A single morning changedeverything. So red with blood, flames, and… flowers.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Koyehn is so far from me now. An island of sand, blotted with ash.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Peace of mind is a journey, where you hold every shade of yourself up to the light.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|The sky isn't blue and the grass isn't green. Nature stirs in hues I can't name.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|It'd be enough for my art to save a single person… Maybe, just myself.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Death is no muse—it bleeds the color from everything it touches.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|There's a side of me Ineedto understand. The side left alone; the side in the dark.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|What legacy will I leave? What'll survive of me? Even my footsteps, are already gone.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Ioniahas an underworld black as ink. I stare into the well, and it stares back.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|At least they'll remember how I make them feel.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Creativity is limitless—for better or worse.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Every mark should have meaning.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Good, evil… the line blurs.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Art is empty without empathy.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|People aren't what they say… but what theyshow.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|My work seeks answers for the most burning questions.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Why can't I paintexactlywhat I imagine…?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|No justice. No revenge. Only clarity.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Life flows in currents. Twisting… Turning.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|A heart bared isn't broken… it's freed.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I'll always be a student of the brush, never its master.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|One breath and brush at a time.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|The surreal makes people admit what's real.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Emotions are most dangerous when silenced.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I'm just a trace of who I was…
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Obsession, keeps the mind awake…
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Everyone's made of contradictions.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|What's heavy in the mind, becomes light on the page.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Act on inspiration when it strikes.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|When others fall to pieces, I gather them up.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Nothing's as simple as black and white.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Relive the pain… relieve the pain.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I choose kindness, until I have no choice.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I keep spiraling down paths I never thought I'd walk.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|YOUR FINAL SIGHT!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|SEE AS I SEE!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|FEEL WITH ME!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Moving on means revisiting what was left behind.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|A piece is never really finished. Just… abandoned.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|No matter where I go… I can't forget where I came from.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I create the quiet that I can't find.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Enough for now. I'll refine the details later.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Loss haunts me like nothing else.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Out of the ashes, into the fire.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|No one can take the part of me that just wants to live.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|And the colors come flooding back…
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Looking
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Stop moving, please—you'd make a greatstill-life.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|…Sorry? My thoughts were… someplace else.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Quickly now!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Moving waters!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Flow!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Follow the river!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Step by step.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Refuge.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|A haven.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Be at ease.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Shelter.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|For safety.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|A painter meets their subject eye to eye.
