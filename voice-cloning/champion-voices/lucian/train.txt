You don't have the heart for this.
I've faced worse.
Don't duck on my account.
Yeah, I got a cure for that.
Plenty for all.
Two in the head.
Time to put you down.
Here comes target practice.
I don't do warning shots.
How you see this goin'?
Both guns blazin'.
Have some peace.
Ready for the beyond?
Sorry I gotta do this.
Got a death wish?
Demonspawn!
Always primed.
Aimin' at you.
Nothin' left but the end.
Gonna need more coffins.
Hope you brought your sidearm.
Eat light.
Thisismercy.
Unclean.
Nothin's pure anymore.
Draw.
Move aside, friend.
Go on, scare me.
Try your luck.
Light 'em up.
Come get some.
I failed...
I'll... wait for her...
Senna...
Purity... and... peace...
Cleanse... me...
How's Demacia? All safe from the Mist? Yeah. You're welcome.
Hey, big fella! Try drinkin' fromthesebarrels.
Need me to wait while you reload that thing?
Hey, gunslinger. I'll let you know if you hit somethin'.
You pointin' that peashooter at me? Let's dance.
A man can gettooclose to his horse, y'know.
I ain't scared'a you, Hecarim. I just hate to put a good horse down.
Hey, pony man! You the one that left that pile over there?
Nothin' I like more than a horse that ain't been broken.
Fortune. 'Fraid I can't help you outta thisHarrowing.
Let's crack you open, Mordekaiser, and see what's inside.
Senna?! Ah, hell. If I'm gonna be shot, I'm glad it's by you.
There she goes, the love of my life.
Looks like we got ourselves a lovers' quarrel. Happy shootin', Senna.
That you, Senna? Uh... is this about me not makin' the bed again?
Lookin' for Thresh. You a friend of his?
If you don't have a heartbeat, you'd best not be movin'.
Whoever made you forgot to turn off the ugly.
Thresh. You're mine.
Got a little somethin' for that lantern: two barrels of righteous fury.
I haven't forgotten you, Thresh, and I sure as hell ain't forgivin'.
'Chain Warden.' Mighty tall name for a sack of bones.
Well, well. If it ain't the ugly low-down corpse that took my Senna.
Someday we'll hunt monsters together, Vayne. But today, we'll hunt each other.
I ain't the monster you're lookin' for, Vayne, but I reckon Icanbe.
The Mist has you in a bad way, friend. Let me help.
You one'a them? Better kill ya to be safe.
One of us finds peace. One of us walks away.
I got two good reasons for you to turn back.
Two guns, one you. Ain't likin' your odds.
Came to kill some ghouls. Guess you'll do.
Nothin' between you and me but gunlight.
I'm just full of salvation. Come get it, friend.
Thanks.
And they say I have a grim sense of humor.
Thisismy happy face... see?
Smile? ...Alright.
No, really... Iamsmiling.
Yep. Reckon that's pure enough.
For the light.
Look at us making new memories.
Sometimes, I see what the darkness is afraid of...
Trust me, you're better off.
Rise again, I dare you.
Bullseyes.
You best stay down!
They never get tired of dyin'.
You been kinda... distant since you came outta that lantern. Somethin' you ain't telling me?
How do you aim that thing? Isn't it heavy?
So what was it like? All that time in the lantern?
Reckon it's time-
TheMistawaits us all. Say goodbye to whatever you care about.
I got two guns. One's for what's in front of me, and one's for what's chasin'.
Ain't enough bullets in the world for all the killin' I'm about to do.
Look at 'em all. Not even knowin' they're following me to hell.
Fight's this way. If you're coming along, try not to die.
If I believed in something, I'd start prayin' to it right about now.
There's a right side and a wrong side to these guns. Don't wanna be on the wrong side.
Happiness is for other folks. Best I can hope for... is peace.
Huh. Strange place. Beats the hell out of theShadow Isles, though.
No place for feelings in this line of work. A full heart's an easy target.
So my wife is half dead. Not a problem. I'll just... love the half that isn't.
I'll sleep when they're good and dead.
Not too many problems a shot to the head can't fix.
Always save one shot for myself... just in case.
It's not the wraiths that haunt me, it's what could've been.
How do you kill what's already dead? With a fistful of gunlight.
Life... phew... it's a hell of a thing.
One shot for the years we lost, one for the love we can't get back.
Home is where I fight the dead.
When I kill 'em, they stay killed.
Don't need triggers, just need a target.
If you can't run from it, you might as well shoot it.
Some call it magic, I call it good aim.
Keep your guns out, and you'll never need to draw.
I can save her...I can save her...
People never really change... I need to believe that.
Sentinel. Fancy word for someone with nothing to lose.
You stare into the Mist, and the Mist stares back.
I've missed the smell of life.
It ain't the grave I fear... it's what crawls out of it.
I've always fought the Black Mist... never thought I'd be married to it.
Bravest thing I ever did, was getting up this morning.
What we had... can still be. I know it.
These guns run on fury. I never run out.
No sunshine where I'm going.
My wife's eyes glow with spectral magic... I'm sure it's fine.
Now when I hold her, she feels... cold.
This ain't war. Wars end.
Nothing as painful as seeing something good... go bad.
Spend this long around lost souls, and you're bound to lose your own.
If I'm going down, I'm taking all those bastards with me.
Used to think nothing was colder than death, now I know different.
How are you supposed to grieve... when the thing you mourn comes back?
Everyone I shoot is her captor. Everyone I save is her.
Somethin' seems too good to be true? Probably is.
Whatever's in the beyond... I hope it's better than this.
I try to remember her the way she was... maybe it's best I don't.
Seen so much death I don't even notice it anymore.
You can cleanse anything... if you have the right ammunition.
For Senna!
Cleanse in fury!
It ends here!
Ashes and dust!
Reckon I could use a rest, and a break from all the screamin'.
A Sentinel's gotta know when to let his guns cool.
Sometimes the smart thing to do is walk the hell away.
Time to make like a wraith, and disappear.
Right about now, I could use some purifyin' of my own.
It ain't ever a sin to be careful.
Can't run from trouble... sure can delay it for a spell though.
The shot that doesn't kill ya, sure makes you mad as hell.
The Mist won't take me yet.
Looks like no peace for me today.
Saw the beyond. Didn't like it much.
I ain't got time to die.
Oh, someone's gonna pay for that.
I'll have no trouble killing you, and less trouble killing you again.
We'll see how smart that mouth is when theHarrowingcomes.
Tough talk for worm food.
Getting used to it.
Could see how that would be preferable.
Really?
What's to say? You're still cursed.
Well... reckon I shoot something twice, and then you shoot it a third time.
Oh. Ha, ha.
'Cause I tried to... ohhhhh.
I aim to purify.
Try to be less beautiful.
Right. I'll keep up.
Everybody dies. Some just need a little help.
