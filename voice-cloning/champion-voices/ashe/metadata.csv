wavs/audio_0001.wav|Coward! May you die with your eyes closed.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I will face you, sister.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You face an Iceborn!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Feel winter's sting.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|This is my warning to you…!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Fate will treat you coldly!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Never. Lose. Focus!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I do my best work from afar.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Flee from the cold.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You face true ice—you face death.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Fate did not choose you.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|As ice shatters, so shall you!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|My arrows fly true.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I was raised for war! I am Iceborn.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|My aim is steady.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Hmph, the cold does not forgive.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You would challenge an Iceborn?
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I greet you; as a Freljordian!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|'Thunk'!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|My mercy has limits!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I don't miss.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|All that frost touches, we know.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Reveal what is hidden.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Show us a path!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Anivia, guide us!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Spirit, reveal our way.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Lead our way.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Anivia, how often have I sought your guidance? And how like a god to betray a mortal's trust!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Braum! What are you doing over there?! Are you drunk?
wavs/audio_0030.wav|So, Braum. No shirt, huh? And I don't have pants. Yay, Freljord.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Braum, we are a winter people from a frozen land. So we must… pop it, pop it!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Gragas! Are you blind?! You're on the wrong side…again!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Lissandra, the fate of our people hangs in the balance, and you betray me?!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|You named me battlesister and kin, Sejuani.Do not make me fight you!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|So, which one is the pig? Kidding!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Trolls are the enemy of mankind! You will die like a beast!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Tryndamere…? What have you become?!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Shaman, I am no enemy of the old gods or Sejuani! Must we fight?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Ancient one,go! The Volibear is honored here, but unwanted!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Prepare yourself, you face an Iceborn!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|I am Ashe, Daughter ofGrena! Warmother of the Avarosans!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Know this! I am Ashe! Iamthe bow!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Hahaha! Check this out… Agh! Ugh, who makes a bow out of ice?!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I don't have to see you to shoot you… Ah, ow! Ugh, oh. Really?!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Sejuani…! Goodbye, sister.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Die, troll. My tribe will destroy your foul race!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Tryndamere, my love. I always suspected this would be our end.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|May the voices quiet for you, shaman.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Man no longer needs the Volibear. Return, and I will slay you again.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|You fought an Iceborn! Death was the only possible outcome.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Heh. Svaag, I have seen babies fight better than you!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Right between the eyes.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Are all southerners so weak?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|They fought an Iceborn, they died.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I only needed one shot.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Svaag, warmblood, was that your best? I killed you without trying.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|No one escapes my aim.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|No one escapes my bow.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|No sagas will mark their passing.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Mark where they died; that was as close as they got.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|No one escapes winter.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|PraiseOrnn, the Firebringer. I ask for your wisdom, First Builder and Forgelord.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I loved my mother. I loved my battlesister. I love my people. It is because of this love that I fight.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|I dream of the day after the tribes are unified. I dream of no longer needing to lead.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|In the North, a great chieftain is called 'Warmother.' Who but a mother has the right to risk lives in war?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Clan or tribe, they will join us. This is the will of Avarosa.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|We praise the leader who unifies, forgetting it is only the unity that matters.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|The goddess Avarosa… I say I hear her voice. But I hear only my mother's; and mourn her passing.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|PraiseAnivia, the Frostbringer. Let us feel the coming of change. Grant us the freedom to travel in safety.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|PraiseKindred, the Two Hunters. Pray we see death's approach, so we may complete our labors and die with our eyes open.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Hmph, 'destiny'. I have always hated that word. It is a wyrm that ruins lives and murders innocence. It is a deceiver and bringer of woe.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|What is it to lead? It is to lie. It is to preach caution even when you are elated. It is to give hope even when you feel none.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Avarosan is the tribe of many, because all Freljordians are one people.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Avarosa speaks one truth, as all gods must. She is our dream of unity.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|It is not the goddess Avarosa's glory I wish to recapture; it is our people's.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I have heard no better words than 'The strong must try the impossible.' This is the oath I must fulfill.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|The Three Sisters are a myth that has strangled our people. It is a tale of failure.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|I am a Warmother—a chieftain—only because no one else will do what must be done.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Bless us,Ildhaurg, Warden of Sacrifice. Protect myhusband. Protect my people. If my death pleases you, let it sustain my tribe.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|You do not aim a bow at the target, you fire knowing where the target will be. This, is vision.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Blessed1Three Sisters. Give me strength to endure what I must. Give me courage to fight who I must. Give me knowledge to see the truth.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Glory to theVolibear, the Thousand-Pierced Beast. Give my people the resilience of your wilderness and the fury of your storm.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I am a Warmother. I have given oaths to few. I have taken oaths from many.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|My tribe will bring peace to the North! The South should fear us.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|They think me cold. I have seen things the Southerners cannot imagine.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I will show them the power of anIceborn.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|The Freljord shall unite!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Together, we are strong. Together, we are…Avarosan.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Gods and spirits guide us. But our lives… are our own.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I am Freljordian. Family, tribe, they are all.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|The day our tribes are one, the world will tremble.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Avarosa guide me.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Today, the fate of our people hangs in the balance.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Hearthbound and Iceborn; Spirit Walker and Fireborn; all Freljordians are my kin.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Seek peace, but bring the tools of war.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Do not confuse mercy for weakness.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I will not allow us to be divided. We are one.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|No fate is written, except by us.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I was born into poverty—all Freljordians are.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Peace requires a steady hand.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|We are all kin of kin. Blood, of blood.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|A battle worthy of the Freljord.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|When I say Avarosa, I hear my mother, and her dreams…
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Swiftly now!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|We will unite theFreljord.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I dream of a nation for my people.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Move quickly, position well, and the battle is won before blood is drawn.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|My people know only cold and hardship… I will teach them peace.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The bow is my will given form: I am it; it is me.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Lead the target.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|What is goodness but trying to do better than your forebears?
wavs/audio_0113.wav|There will be peace in the Freljord. Iwillforge it.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I do not seek the throne of Avarosa.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|We must press on!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I hold a bow ofTrue Ice. I hold my heart.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Let's see how close they can get.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The ice is not pain, it is surrender.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Thisis the fury of an Iceborn!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Faster than my arrows? I think not!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Rain death!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Strike quickly!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Stand together!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I am the bow!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|This is the latest in Freljordian fashion. They call it a… skirt.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Take a good look; it's the last you'll get.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|This outfit makes total sense, just look closer and think about it… less.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Make it count!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Away!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Arrows, fly!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Can't miss!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Let fly!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I won't miss!
