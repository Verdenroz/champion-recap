Doubt is the greatest enemy.
One cut, of many.
Blade and body.
This will be... a harsh lesson.
Never await victory.
Observe.
Defend yourself.
Quit monkeying around!
Pupil, show me what you have learned.
Wuju... pass me that potion?
A true master is an eternal student.
Doubt is the greatest enemy.
The focused mind can pierce through stone.
Anger gives motivation without purpose.
I will show you the path.
Form before strength.
Let us begin.
Do not let your pride blind you.
In me,Wujulives on.
Did you miss it?
A master stroke!
Many foes, one strike!
Watch, and learn.
So fast.
Speed of thought!
Keep up!
You wish to learn the hard way, I see.
I will take an eye! ...As if I don't have enough already.
Your skills are inferior!
Mind and body.
Look inward.
My blade is yours.
