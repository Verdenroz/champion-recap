wavs/audio_0033.wav|Your terror bears no teeth againstme, Cho'Gath.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Darkin—twisted by Shurima, fallen to the Void, bound to your weapon. I get it.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Fiora! Ready for a rematch?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|ICATHIA!!There, a battle cry before your beatdown, Garen.

wavs/audio_0038.wav|You testing me, Illaoi? I'm in.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Pride's powerful once it'searned, K'Sante. Let me demonstrate!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Aww, if it isn't the whipper-snapper in a Void wrapper. Care to spar?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Kassadin. Alone against the Void, it's only a matter o' time before it gets to ya.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Ughh, Kayle. Being so self-righteous takes all the fun outta fighting!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|'Prophet of the Void'? Bet you didn't seethiscomin'!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I don'treadhistory, Nasus. I make it.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I don't hold grudges, Shuriman. But I don't hold back, either.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Void-born! I'll light the way back to the pit you crawled out of!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Zilean, a man of Icathia. You save the past, I've got the future.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You stretch first?  Be embarrassing if you pulled something.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|We duel to the death! ...Or 'til you surrender, I'm not picky.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Don't care who you are or where you're from! Question is, can you fight?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Really don't wanna fight you! ...HA!Who am I kidding,line up.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Hold on—let me grab some more 'wisdom' and 'experience'!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Make it quick! I'm feeling peckish and got a boiled egg waiting for me.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Oh, this? Just a fancy-lookin' lamp, don't worry about it.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Show me something new; I'll even give you the first hit!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Wily one!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Eatin' good tonight!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Anglin' takes patience.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Life swims on.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|And now... I wait.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Not bad! I'll have to remember that one for the road.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Couldn't even defeat me as a literal sword, Aatrox!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Thatwas over easy.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Keep your empire to yourself, 'feathers'!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|'Void Empress'? More like 'Void... unimpressed.'
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Shut your gullet, Cho'Gath!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Loosen up, Fiora! Tension ruins your technique.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Just getting started!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Solid warmup! Who's next?
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Keep 'em comin'!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Icathian lamp: 1. Nazuman ntofos: 0.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Well, Kai'Sa, what did you learn?
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Pipe down, prophet!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Nowyou'rehistory, Nasus!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Against any weapon, any army, anyone,I remain unmatched!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|The croc that croaked. Seen everything now...
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Turret had it comin'.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Tower looked at me funny.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|They really just let me do that, huh?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|All brick, no bite!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Next.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|jack of all trades.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|What you lacked in fortitude, you made up in... uh, dirt.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Shame. You coulda turned the tides with a bit more practice.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Good try! You almost left a scratch.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Hey! Let this light a fire under you.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Yes, you did just lose to a guy with a lamppost.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Still packs a wallop after all this time!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I never get tired of a worthy fight!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Looks like I'll be carrying more than my own weight today.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Listen here, people: I'm not here to clean up your messes! This is a lamp, not a mop!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|If you get lost, look for my light! Unless, of course, it's lodged in somebody's skull.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Bearing the Light ofIcathiain a run-of-the-mill lantern? Just my style.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|A battle, here? Huh, I thought they'd never ask!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Shed my old name a long time ago... Didn't deserve it anymore.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|If my old Kohari comrades saw me now... hmm... they'd probably say I've lost my touch.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Felt lost before, but you know... I never felt defeated.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|My flame's been burnin' a good while. Still haven't found someone worthy to carry the torch.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Living through rough times makes ya appreciate the simple things, like good company... or a hard-boiled egg.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Bravest hero I ever knew was just a kid. Here's to you, champ.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Love sittin' 'round the lamplight and counting my scars after a long day o' beatin' up bad guys.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Icathia fell, but the rest of the world won't follow! Not on my watch.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Back in my day, we didn't need fancy weapons! Hmph... still don't.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Hmm... Any good fishing spots 'round here?
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Could go for a boiled egg right about now.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Learned every weapon, bested every opponent.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Old man with a lamp, comin' through!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Some say I'm battle-hardened! Hardly!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Always a reason to keep on keepin' on.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I'll test their mettle against my fire.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Gotta keep limber at my age.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Boldness is earned, win after win!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Picked up a few tricks during my wandering!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Last light of Icathia, first line of defense.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Might have to makeanotherheroic last stand!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|These old bones haven't failed me yet!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Warriors, rulers, gods... they all bleed the same!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Well, the end o' the world isn't gonna stop itself.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Sky looks mighty free ofVoid! You're welcome.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Next fool to ask about my face gets amouthful o' lamp!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Nothing wrong with a life of peace... Could never find one myself.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|No sword and shield beats old faithful!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Show meall your might!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Never one tolose!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Stand...fight!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Givin' the enemy a breather!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Oh, wait a second—forgot my fishing pole!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Key to being the best is knowing when to rest.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Time-out! Gotta sharpen my... lamp.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Gotta go, the eternal light needs more fuel!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Didn't seethatcomin', even though I've got... how many eyes?
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Ouch! ...Don't much care for the humblin'.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Ooh, I'll be feelin'thatin the morning...
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Not as spry as I used to be, I guess.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Can't tell if they just got lucky or if that took real skill.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Those knuckleheads are getting too rowdy!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Alright, now I put myserioushelmet on!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Got any senior discounts?
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Shopkeep hitting me harder than my enemies...
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Ugh. Inflation's really gettin' outta control...
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Ha! Still trying to sell me anactualweapon!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Fighting words! My favorite kind.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Let's do this.
