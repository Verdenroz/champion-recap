Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?
You're starting to bore me.
Duck! Hehe, just kidding, that won't help.
No need to be scared—or alive.
Stay still! I'm trying to shoot you!
You're not laughing…!
I'll give you to the count of—time's up!
I feel like I forgot to shoot something…
Any last words? Ha! Heh. No, just die.
Smile! It's called gunplay.
Everybody, panic!
El Chavo de 8
Tcha-tcha-tcha-tcha…!
Gotta die sometime!
P-tchoo!
You're my favorite waste of bullets.
Awww…
Welcome to Snoresville, hat lady! Population: you.
But where are your other guns, hat lady?
You're gonna chase me, fat hands?
I'm over here, fat hands!
Vi? Stands for stupid!
Fishbones, you know what we oughta do? 'Do the laundry, wash dishes and pay some bills.' Stupid dumb rocket launcher…
Maybe we should settle down and live peaceful lives. 'Really? I always hoped one day you'd--' Haha, nope! You're a death machine for life!
Hey Fishbones, think we can wreak havoc forever? 'No, you should buy a home and save for retirement.' You know I can replace you, right?
Hey Fishbones, should we blow something up? 'You might inconvenience people and hurt their feelings.' Ugh, you're the worst weapon ever!
Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?
I don't even thinkonceabout blowing stuff up!
I'm crazy! Got a doctor's note.
Bullets!
All part of the plan I just made up!
Ask me if I'm listening…! Hint: I'm not!
I really need a new gun. But don't tell my other guns.
Hold on! I'm about to say something really cool!
Who needs reasons?
You thinkI'mcrazy? You should see mysister!
I have the best intentions!
Now where was I? Oh, right, wreaking havoc!
What if I had a gun that… shot other guns?
I'm trying to care! But I just… can't!
Jinx? Stands for Jinx! Durr.
She's such a loser, always ready to cry! Ta-ta-ta-taa!
I'm wearing lots of belts! (Whispering) For no reason at all.
Catch!
Woo!
Bye bye!
Watch this!
See ya!
I'll be right back! No one die screaming without me!
Isn't that just like a wop? Brings a knife to a gun fight.

Guns don't kill people. I mean, until you shoot 'em. Then they kill everything!
Zap!
