wavs/audio_0001.wav|I'd rather be home anyway.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Move! I'm busy.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Deep breaths.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Teach me something new.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Stay back!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Leave me alone!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You're in my personal space.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Interesting choice.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|This is field research!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Don't touch me.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I have better things to do!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Let's get this over with!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You're angering the spirits!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Respect my boundaries.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Thanks! I hate it.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Pew!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Phow!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Prrring!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|All together now...!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Haestryr... I'm s-... sorry...
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I haven't... done enough.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Back to the Spirit Realm...
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Through the looking glass!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|A door, unlocked!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|One realm, to another!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Ysjarn, I've been searching for you. My friend Haestryr, heneedsyour help.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Ashe, you want to bridge theFreljord'sdivide. But unity isn't harmony.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I'm something of a witch myself, you know!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You're not human. But... you're not a spirit either. You are however... Very loud.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|The pain you carry... I've never seen anything like it.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Nagakabourosis your god, right? I'd love to know more.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Wolf and Lamb... I didn't think I'd meet you so soon!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You are no witch, Lissandra. You're adisease.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Same hat? Same hat.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Well met, Ramhaurg! I have so much to share with you since we last spoke!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|This is the culmination of my research. Spirit friend... I can help you!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I recognize those ravens. Are you their owner? Or, do they own you?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|We meet again, spirit walker. Care to catch up after this?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I can feel you trying to invade my mind, Valhir. Cut it out...!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You stain your blade with spirits, Yone! Why hurt what you can heal?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|"""A yordle!! I've never seen one in the material realm before!"
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Aurora gasps.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|It seems we're temporary collaborators. I know just the topic to... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Your chaos!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I've exceeded my capacity for social interaction today...!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|My work is at a critical juncture, so this interruption is not ideal.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Oh, you're interested in spirits? I have so much to share! Where do I start...
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Ta-da! Hilarious, right?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|That had the components of a joke, but... it wasn't funny.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Ysjarn, be reborn. Haestryr and I will find you again.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Ashe, your ideas may be noble, but your execution is lacking.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Thank you, Illaoi. I'll be adding theSerpent Islesto my list.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I'll tell you when I'm ready to go, Kindred.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Lissandra — I'llhealwhat you've defiled.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Goodbye, little friend.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|So strange, yet so cute.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|We'll talk later, Ramhaurg!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Ah, finally! Now where was I?
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I can still help...! Let me organize my notes, and we can try again.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|These turrets are not conducive to my work.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|That was... easy. Who constructed this?
wavs/audio_0062.wav|See you again soon, spirit walker! I always appreciate our repartee.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Your feral nature doesn't scare me, Valhir.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Killing spirits willneverbring you peace, Yone.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Where do yordles go when they die...? Back toBandle City?
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Bookmarked for later study.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Enough of that, thank you.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Well, that was a waste of my time.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Back to work.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You'll enjoy being a spirit, it's nice.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Knowledge is power... Try reading a book.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I lost my train of thought.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|It's such a relief to have you here, Ramhaurg. Our other colleagues are so... loud.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Ooh, another spirit! Wow, look at you! Oh... you're going that way? Okay, we'll talk later!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Spirit walker; I'm looking forward to working with you again. I'll show you what I've learned.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Unless you know anything about spirits or theSpirit Realm, you'd do well to let me focus on my work.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Do any of you wanna talk about spirits? ...I'll assume that's a yes!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I have my book, my wand, my starting supplies... Do I need anything else? Okay... Let's go!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|This region is teeming with wayward spirits. I'll find and help themall.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Just so you all know, I'll be focused on my research. You can expect to receive my notes once I'm done.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Spending time with others is exhausting. If I seem curt, don't take it personally.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The worst fate for aDemi-godis to be forgotten. I won't let that happen to Haestryr.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Okay. Let's go.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I see the Spirit Realm and material realm simultaneously — this blended world is my own... and it's beautiful.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|You know, technically, we're never more than five steps from a spirit.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|This is far too much walking.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Spirits become wayward by absorbing the pain of mortals. It's my job to cleanse what each wisp has endured.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I want to help Haestryr more than anything, but I'm not strong enough... yet.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|The Spirit Realm, the material realm... they aren't mirror images, but two halves of one existence.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|So little is documented about the Spirit Realm — my work will help others understand what they can't see!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Once I'm done here, I'm going to celebrate by reviewing everything I've learned. I love paperwork.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|We're all just a collection of fragile bones held together by sinew and muscle. At least I'll be a spirit in my next life.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|No one is ever truly alone: spirits are all around us!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Fascinating! I'll review this later.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Spirits aresolucky they're not people.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|I quite enjoy my own company!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Auntie Havu would like it here. She loves drama.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I go where my research takes me.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|How can anyone be afraid of ghosts? They're adorable!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Haestryr, my friend... I'll do all I can to help you.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Weaknesses can also be strengths.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I see, I see... very interesting.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Would anyone notice if I just...left.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Oh! I've read about this!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|So few see the world as I do.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The sounds, the smells... I hate it.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|The spirits here are different from the ones in theFreljord.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The spiritual balance here is... off.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I woke up early for this...
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I should write home. So my... family knows I'm still alive.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I like when it's quiet — I can hear myself think.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Follow me. I'll help you.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Hope you don't mind the detour!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|You'll be safe with me.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I appreciate the company.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Let me guide you home.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Hello, little spirit.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|P-cha!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Open your mind!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Seemyworld!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|With eyes unclouded.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Beautiful, isn't it?
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Take it in.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I see your spirit.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|My worlds converge!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|See between!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|You're in my realm now!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Give me a second to decompress.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Anyway. Bye.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|This is a lot to process... I'll return after a break in the Spirit Realm.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|How does anyone fight for this long... It's exhausting.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|I won't let Haestryr be forgotten! There has to be more I can do.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The material realm is such an eye strain... One moment, I need a change of scenery.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Still corporeal... Oh well!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Okay, back to work! The spirits here still need me.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Oh, we're not done? ...We're still fighting? ...Okay.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Note to self: repeating previous actions may lead to unfavorable results.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|That was... not ideal; but I won't let this derail me.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Everything is so... expensive.Explain.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|No, I am not interested in purchasing any carrots.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Pewww... ding!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Steven Universe
wavs/audio_0143.wav|What an 'interesting' thing to say out loud.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Between worlds.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Crossing over.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Beyond the veil.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|See with eyes unclouded.
