Sett_Original_E_1.wav|sett|en|Facebreaker!
Sett_Original_E_2.wav|sett|en|Bustin' heads!
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterBilgewater.wav|sett|en|Hey, Bilgerat. You see my pop? He'd be a scumbag like you.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterNoxians_0.wav|sett|en|You Noxians ain't all bad. You ain't all good, either.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterNoxians_1.wav|sett|en|You Noxians may have started the fight pits, but I damn sure perfected 'em.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterNoxians_2.wav|sett|en|Hey, you're Noxian, just like my pa. I'll try not to hold it against ya.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterNoxians_3.wav|sett|en|You know the deal, Noxus. Stay outta my business, and I stay outta yours.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterVastaya_0.wav|sett|en|You know, my mom's a Vastaya. That's the only reason I ain't stomped you yet.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterVastaya_1.wav|sett|en|Look at you! Old blood Vastaya! You too good for me? Huh?
Sett_Original_FirstEncounterVastaya_2.wav|sett|en|You're about to see my human side—the part that ain't so nice.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_0.wav|sett|en|Look at that face. It's just screamin' 'punch me'!
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_1.wav|sett|en|You're the number one contender? Hah, I must've really cleaned out the division.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_2.wav|sett|en|Welcome to my show! If you live, I'll have you back.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_3.wav|sett|en|If you even dream o' whoopin' me, you better wake up and apologize.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_4.wav|sett|en|My old man ran off. You'd be smart to do the same.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_5.wav|sett|en|You got guts. Too bad I gotta put my fists through 'em.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_6.wav|sett|en|Look sharp, meat! You're in the main event now.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_7.wav|sett|en|To be the boss, you gotta beat the boss. I don't see you bein' the boss.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_8.wav|sett|en|Hah! I ain't about to lose to that.
Sett_Original_FirstEncounter_9.wav|sett|en|I ain't never lost. You know that, right?
Sett_Original_Joke.wav|sett|en|Love you, Ma. See ya tomorrow. Mwah.
Sett_Original_KillPenta_0.wav|sett|en|Someone get the cart!
Sett_Original_KillPenta_1.wav|sett|en|Look out, there's a new boss 'round here!
Sett_Original_Kill_0.wav|sett|en|Ooh... you should get some ice on that.
Sett_Original_Kill_1.wav|sett|en|Get that money.
Sett_Original_Kill_2.wav|sett|en|You ain't the one.
Sett_Original_Kill_3.wav|sett|en|Nope. Not a contender.
Sett_Original_Kill_4.wav|sett|en|You might wanna stay down.
Sett_Original_Kill_5.wav|sett|en|Get 'em off my floor.
Sett_Original_Kill_6.wav|sett|en|Yeah... that's what I do.
Sett_Original_Kill_7.wav|sett|en|That's a KD... knocked-dead.
Sett_Original_Kill_8.wav|sett|en|That's a concussion.
Sett_Original_Kill_9.wav|sett|en|Ya missed.
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|sett|en|Wait, hold up. Are we gettin' paid for this?
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|sett|en|Five versus five? Heh. What kinda sicko is runnin' this rumble?
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|sett|en|Okay, everyone here knows how to throw a punch, right? 'Cause I don't have time for lessons.
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|sett|en|Listen up, if any o' you don't die out there, I might have work for ya.
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|sett|en|The boss is here. Hold your applause... seriously, be quiet.
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|sett|en|Hey, is there a doctor on hand? Asking for my opponents.
Sett_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|sett|en|Hey, uh, listen... My Momma don't need to know about any o' this. 'Kay?
Sett_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|sett|en|Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
Sett_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|sett|en|They say you learn a lot from a beating. If that's true, I've made the whole world smarter.
Sett_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|sett|en|I used to risk my neck in the pit making someone else rich. Now, we do it the other way around. I like that better.
Sett_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|sett|en|When you're on top, there's always some chump trying to drag you down, pullin' at your feet, scuffin' up your nice shoes.
Sett_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|sett|en|They called me 'Sett the Beast-Boy Bastard.' Hah! Now, it's 'Sett the Beast-Man Bastard.'
Sett_Original_MoveLong_5.wav|sett|en|Looks like I brought my fists to a knife fight. Honestly, I feel bad for the knives.
Sett_Original_MoveLong_6.wav|sett|en|I remember my first fight. I ran home cryin' to Momma... she wiped my tears with her claws.
Sett_Original_Move_0.wav|sett|en|Every single one of 'em thinks they're the one to beat me. 'Kay.
Sett_Original_Move_1.wav|sett|en|I don't like hurtin' people. I like the money I get from hurtin' people.
Sett_Original_Move_10.wav|sett|en|My coat costs more than this whole damn place.
Sett_Original_Move_11.wav|sett|en|They call me a thug. I call me an entrepreneur.
Sett_Original_Move_12.wav|sett|en|If anyone's watching this fight... they owe me money.
Sett_Original_Move_13.wav|sett|en|Ah, the line of people trying to take me down just ain't long enough.
Sett_Original_Move_14.wav|sett|en|I ain't no 'half-breed'... I'm a full breed, and I'm the only one.
Sett_Original_Move_15.wav|sett|en|Too hairy for humans, too smooth forVastaya. What're you gonna do?
Sett_Original_Move_16.wav|sett|en|I don't bother with jabs; if you're throwing, throw it hard.
Sett_Original_Move_17.wav|sett|en|Gah, probably shouldn't've have worn my nice pants to this.
Sett_Original_Move_18.wav|sett|en|It's all fun and games 'til someone gets their face caved in.
Sett_Original_Move_19.wav|sett|en|All words are fightin' words.
Sett_Original_Move_2.wav|sett|en|The crackin' of bones is the clinkin' of coins.
Sett_Original_Move_20.wav|sett|en|No tappin' out in my pit.
Sett_Original_Move_21.wav|sett|en|Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth.
Sett_Original_Move_22.wav|sett|en|All men wanna be me, too bad they ain't me.
Sett_Original_Move_23.wav|sett|en|Everyone loses... well, almost everyone.
Sett_Original_Move_24.wav|sett|en|Some beatings you just gotta do yourself.
Sett_Original_Move_25.wav|sett|en|Somewhere out there is a demand that needs supplyin'.
Sett_Original_Move_26.wav|sett|en|Who's lookin' to lose a fight today?
Sett_Original_Move_27.wav|sett|en|Y'know... you don't really know someone until you fought 'em to the death.
Sett_Original_Move_28.wav|sett|en|Ionia... place was so damn quiet before I came along.
Sett_Original_Move_29.wav|sett|en|Violence is my business, and business is booming.
Sett_Original_Move_3.wav|sett|en|Ugh... Hey, anyone know whose teeth are stuck in my knuckles?
Sett_Original_Move_30.wav|sett|en|People say they don't like violence... but they all watch.
Sett_Original_Move_31.wav|sett|en|Glad I don't have to fight me.
Sett_Original_Move_32.wav|sett|en|Bein' the boss is a lot better than not bein' the boss.
Sett_Original_Move_33.wav|sett|en|Momma always said I had her temper.
Sett_Original_Move_34.wav|sett|en|Only thing an honest livin' makes you is broke.
Sett_Original_Move_4.wav|sett|en|If I ever find my old man... well, I hope he's been trainin'.
Sett_Original_Move_5.wav|sett|en|Technique... is for lightweights.
Sett_Original_Move_6.wav|sett|en|You swing on the boss? You better not miss.
Sett_Original_Move_7.wav|sett|en|Nothin' people hate more than a guy who makes somethin' of himself.
Sett_Original_Move_8.wav|sett|en|Must be a fight brewin', my fur just stood up.
Sett_Original_Move_9.wav|sett|en|Nothin' I hate more than people with sleeves.
Sett_Original_R_0.wav|sett|en|THIS IS GONNA HURT!
Sett_Original_R_1.wav|sett|en|NOW FOR THE FINISH!
Sett_Original_R_4.wav|sett|en|GOIN' FOR A RIDE!
Sett_Original_Recall_0.wav|sett|en|Uh, be right back. Gotta check on some, uh... legitimate business.
Sett_Original_Recall_1.wav|sett|en|Pause the fight! Forgot to stretch. Don't wanna pull nothin'.
Sett_Original_Recall_2.wav|sett|en|Little break between rounds. Then, come out swingin'.
Sett_Original_Recall_3.wav|sett|en|Y'know, life's really all about the quiet timebetweenbeatdowns.
Sett_Original_Recall_4.wav|sett|en|Things I love... uh, my Momma, breakin' necks, and fine Ionian silk.
Sett_Original_Recall_5.wav|sett|en|Hold up! Gotta ice the knuckles.
Sett_Original_Respawn_0.wav|sett|en|Ain't even thinkin' 'bout throwin' in the towel.
Sett_Original_Respawn_1.wav|sett|en|I almostfeltthat one!
Sett_Original_Respawn_2.wav|sett|en|Alright. I'm warmed up now.
Sett_Original_Respawn_3.wav|sett|en|So, that's losin', huh? Not my favorite thing.
Sett_Original_Respawn_4.wav|sett|en|Aw great, did that leave a mark?
Sett_Original_Respawn_5.wav|sett|en|It ain't how many times you get knocked down. It's how many times you get back up.
Sett_Original_Respawn_6.wav|sett|en|Well... when life gives you lemons, punch life in the throat.
Sett_Original_Taunt.wav|sett|en|Anyone wants a piece of me, line forms right here.
Sett_Original_TauntResponse_0.wav|sett|en|It's easy to talk big when you still got all your teeth.
Sett_Original_TauntResponse_1.wav|sett|en|You think I got where I am by listening to people?
Sett_Select.wav|sett|en|I'm undisputed.
