If you can't beat them, join them
Frank Herbert's
Cling to hope... It is all you have.
I am Zaun's reckoning!
Hahaha... Is that crying I hear? Or are you mewling?
No more hope.
Chaos will set you free.
All must be tested.
The barons are not your masters—fear is.
This pain is a gift.
You listen to my words, while myweaponsspeak!
I am not your enemy.
Feel this. The pain will prove useful later.
Zaun, bear witness.
Break men to break their shackles.
Your cries will give voice to chaos.
The fortunate will be the first to fall.
Existence is torment.
Embrace your fear.
Iamthe weapon.
You will thank me, between the screams.
What didn't kill me, will kill you!
Steel isstronger.
You have already lost.
A crucible of pain!
You cannot rule what I have turned to ash!
Life favors the strong.
The suffering is only beginning.
Another slave to pain.
I offer redemption.
What will you do to survive?TELL ME!
They put me in chains. They gave me my weapon.
Death will end your agony.
You will know fear.
Pain will not betray you.
You will fall so far.
I will lay your weakness bare.
Do not fight it. Shh...
Do you think me so weak as to fall for your charms?
My, my. What have they been up to in Piltover?
I must admit, I have a thing for... legs.
The hand of Noxus can be cut off; ask yourmaster.
A pale imitation.
My replacement? Really, now?
This one... has potential.
The child is learning.
If you feed on pain, I welcome you to the feast.
Give me a reason to fear you.
You defeated Noxus. For that, I will make this quick.
I heard you like to give hugs.
The city calls for chaos. She is but the first to answer.
I hope your father begged when Swain betrayed him.
Where do your loyalties lie? I will bury you next to them.
This is not your land, and that lizard doesn't even like you.
Noxus is lost.
Piltover is a parasite.
Let the rage carry you... into my chains.
You respect strength. Good. Then you understand.
Noxus failed you... when it did not punish your betrayal!
Caught between two worlds? I'll drag you out of both.
You've felt my pain. Now feel yours.
I will not kneel to a deceiver.
Your coat isn't even as nice as mine.
Compared to what you do, this is merciful.
Don't be greedy, there's enough pain for all of us.
Beneath those gloves... you are broken.
The only thing you enforce is limitations.
You can die beside them, but you will never be a Demacian.
You were made to be a weapon. Embrace it.
This... is going to be messy.
There is always another trial.
Think of all that you have survived.
Zaun welcomed me with open arms... and a knife to my back.
But I still have so much to kill for.
What exactly have I been killing...?
Hold on... There's something... Ahhh, that's better.
I was stronger.
Are none of you worthy?!
A pathetic display.
Do not waste my time.
Zaun, let this be your warning.
You disappoint me.
Sacrificed for the cause.
One falls, as many rise.
You admit your weakness.
At last, you know your place.
Raise them up on chains. Zaun will see my message.
Now, to destroy everything you love.
Enjoy this final moment... before your trial begins.
Controlling them will be simple... with my hand around their throats.
It is time... for them to die.
If they could only comprehend the truth of the Dredge... I wouldn't need to drive it into their skulls.
We will rise from the rubble, stronger than before.
Few will endure the chaos to come.
Your fear, given chemtech and flesh.
Their future is carved into my flesh.
Only those who survive this city deserve it.
The Dark Knight Rises
This is the only truth that matters: a weapon aimed at your head.
Strength... will be tested.
Where will they run when the whole city burns?
There is no coming back.
Who among you are worthy?
I answer tono one. No matter how loudly they beg.
I want to see their faces when I tear their hope away.
I am the very definition of a self-made man.
I was not reborn in the depths. I merely refused to die.
I am stronger than man, stronger than machine, I am an idea.
If they do not stop me, they will die. It is just that simple.
Screams follow in my wake.
A new order... chaos.
A city, choking in the Chem-barons' grasp.
The weak are condemned.
Zaun will be redeemed... in the flames.
Carnage—as intoxicating as chemtech.
Endless misery, mhm... Wonderful.
Such marvels, built of pain.
Their cries are calling me home.
Cast into a pit of despair, I climbed out on the corpses.
Power. Fear. These are my weapons.
I will guide you to a new age, born of destruction.
Think how much stronger they'll be... if they live.
Tear their weakness away, andnothingis left!
Brutality. I approve.
Come back when you are stronger.
Run, if you must.
You try to flee, not realizing... you are in chains.
Do you feel... safer?
Strength comes from suffering.
You only prolong your agony.
Was the pain too much?
Did you think that would save you?
Unworthy.
The weakdeserveto die!
If only you were stronger.
Mortal Kombat
You only have yourself to blame.
Freed by chains.
No one will shed a tear. That is why you cry.
What kind of monster would kill a child? Oh... right.
The world does not need gods.
Stars fall the hardest.
Say 'Shurima'one more time!
You'd think a nation of pirates would never bow.
I considered you my equal. I was wrong.
I am all the weapon I need.
The walls come tumbling down.
What'll be born of your suffering?
Noxus already had an executioner.
Your friends are the chain you could not break.
Frankly, I never found you attractive.
Slippery, aren't you?
Cold as death.
Hmph. I thought you would be bigger.
Demacia... Indeed!
I don't know what he said, but he screamed it.
Of all the people to fail a test.
Balance gives way, to chaos.
Make way for Jarvan the Fifth!
You chose... the wrong weapon.
And Piltover rejoices.
I never saw the beauty in death... until now.
A father should be with hisdaughter.
The storm... breaks.
That thing spit in my eye.
Every one of you, as dead as the last.
I had my fill of stones in the Dredge.
You finally live up to your name.
The stars are too far away to help you.
Power must be earned.
Every empire falls.
Friends to the end, how inspiring.
As the bones foretold: a quiet,peacefuldeath!
You died the moment you let a god control you.
Without Zaun, you arenothing!
You were the hero. Now you're dead.
I'm sure Valor will swoop down any second...
A resplendent death; feathers and fur.
Broken, again.
Don't worry, I'll take care of those runes.
So much anger.
I'll finish what the Mist started.
The sands will bury you all.
Aw, Sion. You were already dead to me.
Not. Viable.
No music. Only silence.
You've betrayed me for the last time!
You knew this day would come!
You were never in control.
Obedient to the end.
You bargained away your freedom... for a frozen stick.
I liked the old you more.
Did you say bow, or bow?
In the depths, we are all animals.
Evil needs a new master.
You could have been so much more.
Evolution gives way to revolution.
Blood in, blood out.
The Void may learn, but not quickly enough.
Birds of a feather, die together.
[Let's]Make America Great Again
Your strength has saved you.
There are more trials to come.
Impressive.
Cut their weakness out!
Accept what you have always known.
The end is near.
Keep struggling. Maybe you can save your hat.
Scream louder, I want Swain to hear it!
A duel to your death.
Think of all the innocent barrels I'm saving.
Let me introduce you to death.
Tranquility awaits.
She'llnever escape, and neither will you.
Metal... meet metal.
Here, kitty, kitty...
Your rage makes you... predictable.
Bringing the beast to heel.
Gather your strength. Soon, I will take it.
You die when I choose.
Zaun calls for its headsman.
Our rise cannot be stopped.
Echoing from the depths.
No, please, tell me about your religion.
That is what I want you to think.
Death. Could not. Break me.
Pain is the act of becoming.
What is strength if you do not use it?
It is not violence. It is... philosophy.
You cannot know strength... Until you are broken.
