wavs/audio_0001.wav|Flee, and the spear will find your back.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Cry, war! Louder!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Life was always a war.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|You can only defeat yourself.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Unbroken.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Willpower sets my spear alight.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Do not give up!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|You will not fail if it is worth it.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Everything, or nothing.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Echo for eons.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Again!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Spear and shield. A pantheon.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Power will be your undoing.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|A legion of one.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Fight, because you must!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Before you fight, you must rise.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|No mercy for the strong.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Until my spear dulls.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Let fear make you bold.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Strike now, strike harder!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Between each beat of my heart, I strike.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Into legend.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Aatrox! The World Ender. But from death, comes life.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|The power you sought has destroyed you, Aatrox. You will find no other end.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|You sought to become a god, and you were made their pet.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Parasite!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|The blows of gods cannot shatter the world if they strike me instead!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Darkin or Aspect, it does not matter.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Gods need slaves, and they found you.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I am not the Pantheon you knew, creature. I am Atreus, a mortal, about to slay a dragon!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I once trusted my destiny to the stars, dragon. Now, I trust in steel.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Braveheart
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Is this a god, or a rug?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Battle is a dance, and the fortunate find their partner.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|You preach movement, while anchoring our souls.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Kayn. Either the weapon is redundant, or you are.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Hide behind your faith, Solari, and the robes of your priests.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Beneath Aspect and armor, you are more resilient than you know.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|While you bow to the sun, my spear finds your neck.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Our destiny is to fight, and only the bravest do not refuse it. I understand this, Lunari.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|If only your kind could see what you see, Soraka, they would weep for you as you weep for us.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|You call yourself the Aspect of the Protector, but now the one in need isyou.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|If it isn't the Aspect everyone used to like.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I earned my spear with my brother's dying breath. How did you earn yours, Demacian?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I have faced many self proclaimed gods. The worst wears the face of a child.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Face me.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|We bleed into the same earth, and bleed we must.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Why do you fight?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I call upon the stars… to bake my bountiful breads!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Fresh from my bakery… my secret dream.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|How many hosts must I kill, Darkin?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|The Darkin's final words are not their own… but the cries of humanity.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|All things end!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Mortality can only be severed by the spear's edge.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|The starslie!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Return home on your shield.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Stand up. Face me again.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Keep fighting.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|How you die is who you are.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I will remember your name, and shout it to the heavens.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Glory fades into bloodstains.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|The heavens do not fear me because I am a god, they fear me because I am a man!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Let this day be legend.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|My name is Soldier. By my spear, they will know war.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|They are called gods, but when they die you cannot hear their howls above the wind.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Shields defend hearts. Both yours, and those beside you.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|How much further could we march, if we were not forced to carry our fears on our backs?
wavs/audio_0068.wav|The twilight of the gods comes each morning, when our world shines brighter than the stars.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|The mountain before me is not always high. Heh, it is not always a mountain.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Vengeance is cold. I do not need it on the mountain.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Behind me lies a farm. I wonder if there is bread above the hearth, and if I will ever return.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|We must all find our place. Mine is being cast down, so I can rise once more!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|We are privileged to breathe, to taste the air! It is the last gasp of all who have died before us.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|We are caught between Darkin and Aspect, but we will rise up in spite of them.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The stars are beyond my reach, and so I grasp my spear and take aim.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|When I look to the mountain's peak, in my mind, I have already fallen. And so, I climb.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Heavier than my spear is the weight of only one life.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|After every defeat, I ran around the mountain until even shame could not keep up.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|The man who tastes the venom of gods, must spit his words.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|It is not why I fight, but who I fight for.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I cast my excuses into the dirt.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|There is no pity, no mercy.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Pressing forward is not the same as running from your mistakes.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Spears grow restless before fields of wheat.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|If they bleed, I will call them sister or brother.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|The world moves as the heavens lie still.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Because we fall, the climb must be our destination.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I wear a helm so that I am only a soldier.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I will carve my scars into the heavens.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I buried regret in a grave, along with my name.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|The power of these 'gods' is but an echo of our own.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|The earth is beneath me.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I do not set the pace, I race against it.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The past marches with me.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|There are no enemies, no allies. Only those about to die.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|From the skies they see war, but on earth there is only carnage.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|The art of war is hearing your heart beating, knowing you are alive!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|If they kill me, at least I die a man.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I am the tip of the spear, raised against surrender!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Fall down seven times, stand up eight.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|The people cry out for strength that is already theirs!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Onward! The spear points in only one direction.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Even impaled on a blade, I will press forward!.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|We live our lives in the shadow cast by a mountain.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Death is the only thing that ever embraced me.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|We are what we overcome.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|A clashing of steel… I have heard it all go silent.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I wield my fate as a weapon!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I sought power on Targon's peak, only to find it within.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|The best climbers know how to fall.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Retreat too far on Mount Targon, and you will fall off a cliff.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|The god died. The man lives.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I will not surrender.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|How many times must I die, before I learn to live?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|The beyond can have me when I am done.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I will fall, at least one more time.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Stand back up and never be defeated.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I am no more than a soldier, and no less.
