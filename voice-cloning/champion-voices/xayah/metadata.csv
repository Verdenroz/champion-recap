wavs/audio_0001.wav|Fine, I'll just be over here… sharpening my feathers.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|All out of second chances. Sorry.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|My last nerve is long gone.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Dance like your life depends on it.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Hmm, what shall I cut off?
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Baasi kommu yu-teha.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Keep up!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Threading the needle.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|I leave nasty scars.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Okay, so we're doing this.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|A thousand cuts is only the beginning.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is how I deal with unwanted attention.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|This was our world first.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|A dance with me ends in blood.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|This is a preemptive 'No'.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Listening. Such a simple concept.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Dance.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Yay, someone to throw knives at.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Hear. My. Words!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I don't speak compromise.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Quit crying! It's just a feather.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|It's only a little prick.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Ever been stabbed by a feather?
wavs/audio_0024.wav|My feathers are priceless.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Move your feet, or lose some toes.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Violence is my favorite form of negotiation.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Cut by a feather? So delicate.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Sul alesh!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|When I dance, I lead.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Compromise. It's a pain.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|They make chaos dance.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Call me cute again.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I always find a weak spot.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|What the heck? I deserve it.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|This is overpriced, but I must have it.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Hook me up with that magical creature discount?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Do I really need this? Ah… yes.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Is this ethically sourced?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I want to buy all the things!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Where did you get all these wonderful things?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|But how much does it cost for me?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I am totally pulling this off.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Play it safe!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|You okay?
wavs/audio_0047.wav|With what?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Honey, what are you doing?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|A nice dinner?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|That's not what—
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Do you remember the plan?
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Really? What is it?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Yeah, so?
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Show them the dance.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I'm a little busy!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Baby, what did I tell you?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Close enough.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Yeah, gross.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I saw you. Everyone can see you.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|You want to start it off?
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Really, darling?
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Now's not the time, darling.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Hi.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Are you?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Until we are free. Until magic is free.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Do you remember our escape route?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I'll take that as a no.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|We'll still be alive!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You used the secret call! Is everything alright?
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just… go that way!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|That's right, babe.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Look sharp, baby.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I would never be whole again.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The best.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|There's a surprise.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Will you?
wavs/audio_0078.wav|You! You can know these things!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Are you having fun over there?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|It's the same fight!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|You're doing this!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I hate everyone today!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Not you, baby.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Only if we want to have fun.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|One of them!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|This reminds me of our first dates!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Mind if I cut in, Rakan?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I have your back!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I couldn't miss it!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Make them remember!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Let's show 'em what we got.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|You know I do!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|It is now!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I can think of something.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Can we talk about this later?
wavs/audio_0096.wav|You're cute today!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Rakan is very enthusiastic.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I adore your energy.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Not a single one.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Use your words!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|How long since we last danced?
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Bunch of weirdos.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|All of them!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Ah, it was nothing.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|No. That was me.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Me. I'm counting.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Couldn't have done it without you, mieli.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Well. I'll have to do it more often, then.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Probably, but there are two of us.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I love killing for you.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Rakan, let's not gloat. Much.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|They deserved it.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|They aren't made like us.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|That was a Vastayan farewell.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I was trying to have a moment, Rakan.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Nice job, babe.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Only you can, Rakan.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Yeah?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Keep them distracted.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I'm fine.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|It has to be done.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|You forgot the plan.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|You remember the Aphae waterfall?
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I'd like to go there again.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Yes?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|What the hell were you thinking?
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Yes.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|They're too busy building things.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Because… they're afraid.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|For what?
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Okay, last time, it was totally my fault.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Good answer.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Ask me again tomorrow.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Not now!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Another road, another horizon.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|We can do this.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|What we have is greater than some human word.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|It's lovely.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Ugh, what's with the accent?
wavs/audio_0140.wav|No. No, I do not.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?
wavs/audio_0142.wav|No, that's not whistling.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|If you don't want to do this…
wavs/audio_0144.wav|You're only here because of me.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Shoes.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Yes… but say it anyway.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|'cause then… I wouldn't get to hear you ask.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|We must keep moving.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Think, or know?
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I'm so tired…
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Everyone is depending on me.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|I would… burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|I think scars are sexy.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Where do we go?
wavs/audio_0155.wav|More than yesterday, less than tomorrow.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Do I make you happy, Rakan?
wavs/audio_0157.wav|I'm lucky to have you.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I swear, you will be the death of me.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Me too.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Baasi sur ma-vae!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|If we get separated, I'll find you.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|You're already wandering off.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Why, thank you, darling.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I need you to be more careful.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Stick to the plan.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|We always have a plan.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Ugh, I hate everyone today.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Murdering everyone!
wavs/audio_0169.wav|You… have a plan?
wavs/audio_0170.wav|That's the opposite of a plan.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|It has to be done.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Like you can talk.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|If things go wrong…
wavs/audio_0174.wav|They don'talwaysgo wrong.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Theymostlygo wrong.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Are you pretending to be dumb?
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Soon, baby. Slow down.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Nice to unmeet you.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Why now?
wavs/audio_0180.wav|I think we're supposed to laugh, now?
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Smile and nod, honey.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Alright!
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Dust it off!
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Aw, yeah, let's get down!
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Aw, yeah, come on!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Get down with me!
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Alright, put your back in to it!
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Aw… crap…
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Seriously..?
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Rakan…
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Ugh, lame…
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Uh, seriously..?
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Ugh, lame…
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Oops, your bad!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Nuh uh!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Pinned!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Nope!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Sit down!
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Gotcha.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Eat it!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Oops, your bad.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Didn't see that coming?
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Nope!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Nope!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|You betray your heritage, Ahri.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|I can't wait to burst your bubble.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Wait, magic-powered sword legs? Is this a joke?
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?
wavs/audio_0215.wav|When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Where can I get one of those delightful chthonic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|I want your happiness to evaporate.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|I want to travel the world with you.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|But is it really okay?
wavs/audio_0220.wav|I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|You're gross. Never change.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|You call that a rebellious nature?
wavs/audio_0224.wav|You call that being a vampire?
wavs/audio_0225.wav|We were not made to fight each other.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Okay. Who invited the Yordle?
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Yordles are the reason no one takes us Vastaya seriously.
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Damnit!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Just… no.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Hahaha… I don't know what that is.
wavs/audio_0231.wav|I'm not laughing. I needed to say that, just so you understand.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Behold. I am depleted of cares.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Ha ha ha.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Too bad those tails weren't lives.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Good henchmen are hard to find.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|That was too easy, but so much fun.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy.
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Next.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth.
wavs/audio_0242.wav|They dropped something. Their guard.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|They mindlessly marched right to their deaths. Like everyone in Noxus.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|Maybe I overdid it.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|A victory for the Vastaya.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Hurray, they all died.
wavs/audio_0249.wav|I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|And that's where plucky optimism gets you.
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Crumble! Yes!
wavs/audio_0252.wav|I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Magic is again unfettered.
wavs/audio_0255.wav|Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause.
wavs/audio_0256.wav|We rise.
wavs/audio_0257.wav|Hm, poor construction. No standards.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Shoddy construction, through and through.
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Can you feel the magic flowing? I can.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|They should really get a refund from those masons.
wavs/audio_0261.wav|I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|Another Vastayan victory.
wavs/audio_0263.wav|I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Sabotage looks so good on me.
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Untied that mystical knot.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|Taitah be tervash.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|Mu'takl.
wavs/audio_0268.wav|We asked you to join.
wavs/audio_0269.wav|It needed to be done.
wavs/audio_0270.wav|This is by your design.
wavs/audio_0271.wav|Shame. You could have been so useful alive.
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste.
wavs/audio_0273.wav|The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise.
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Die, little inanimate spy.
wavs/audio_0275.wav|And they won't be needing that any more.
wavs/audio_0276.wav|Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing.
wavs/audio_0277.wav|There's more than one way to blind an enemy.
wavs/audio_0278.wav|Found one! Killed it.
wavs/audio_0279.wav|Well, that's just an invasion of privacy.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|I'm overcome with emotion.
wavs/audio_0281.wav|Anyone else want to try?
wavs/audio_0282.wav|Thanks for the dance.
wavs/audio_0283.wav|Got what they deserved.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|Yep. Easy peasy.
wavs/audio_0285.wav|As far as obstacles go, that was about a… three out of ten?
wavs/audio_0286.wav|And an F, for effort.
wavs/audio_0287.wav|Well, that's done.
wavs/audio_0288.wav|That was for the Vastaya.
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Well, they tried to stop me.
wavs/audio_0290.wav|I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault.
wavs/audio_0291.wav|Alright, who's next?
wavs/audio_0292.wav|Hmm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours.
wavs/audio_0293.wav|What? They were in my way.
wavs/audio_0294.wav|Few can keep up with me.
wavs/audio_0295.wav|Let's cut 'em to ribbons.
wavs/audio_0296.wav|Ah, silence, so golden. Like Rakan. Kind of miss him. Even if he is… noisy.
wavs/audio_0297.wav|The vastaya named the world. We named the trees, the wind, the mountains. We know their power.
wavs/audio_0298.wav|If love is feeling so deeply for another that you want to chew your way under their skin, then I love Rakan…
wavs/audio_0299.wav|We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl. The whole place reeked of vomit, sweat and blood. It was so romantic!
wavs/audio_0300.wav|They'll probably label me a war criminal one day, but not today.
wavs/audio_0301.wav|The world owes the Vastaya a great debt. I'm here to collect.
wavs/audio_0302.wav|I'm just an ordinary girl. An ordinary girl with an infinite supply of death quills.
wavs/audio_0303.wav|Tavern brawls just seem to find me.
wavs/audio_0304.wav|Nature bends towards chaos. Give in, or break.
wavs/audio_0305.wav|Once, magic was everywhere, or as the Vastaya say:om upo sa't.
wavs/audio_0306.wav|Ionia's meddling birthed our rebellion.
wavs/audio_0307.wav|I prefer to work at night, because, y'know, the sun? Bright? Yuck!
wavs/audio_0308.wav|Pandemonium follows me everywhere I go. It's like a puppy I once fed…
wavs/audio_0309.wav|Nature is wild and untamed, not balanced.
wavs/audio_0310.wav|Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases.
wavs/audio_0311.wav|If Rakan were here, I'd make out with him until his ears bled. He loves it when I do that.
wavs/audio_0312.wav|I really hate anyone who's not me… or Rakan.
wavs/audio_0313.wav|Ionians never learn.
wavs/audio_0314.wav|Talking to anybody about anything is never on my to-do list.
wavs/audio_0315.wav|Vi-om tann va'h.
wavs/audio_0316.wav|No one will block my path.
wavs/audio_0317.wav|Rebellion puts the fire in my blood.
wavs/audio_0318.wav|We Vastaya are only half of our full glory.
wavs/audio_0319.wav|All women desire Rakan. Like they'd know what to do with him.
wavs/audio_0320.wav|They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness.
wavs/audio_0321.wav|I will rest when our homelands are restored.
wavs/audio_0322.wav|Our Vastayan essence fades with each passing day.
wavs/audio_0323.wav|Oh, I was born to ruffle feathers.
wavs/audio_0324.wav|Talking to people makes me want to stab them… so I do.
wavs/audio_0325.wav|If our existence is everyone else's chaos, so be it.
wavs/audio_0326.wav|Chaos is the preferred state of nature.
wavs/audio_0327.wav|Victors are the sole authors of history. Time to write our chapter.
wavs/audio_0328.wav|Compromise issounsatisfying.
wavs/audio_0329.wav|Sabotage takes patience and time… and lots of feather daggers.
wavs/audio_0330.wav|I'll do whatever needs to be done… twice, just to be sure.
wavs/audio_0331.wav|Sometimes people die for a good cause – namely, mine. That's why I'm an optimist.
wavs/audio_0332.wav|I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand…
wavs/audio_0333.wav|Cloudy days are my favorite.
wavs/audio_0334.wav|Ionia used to be so nice… before humans tamed all that wild cataclysmic magic.
wavs/audio_0335.wav|Humans. They're so very blind.
wavs/audio_0336.wav|Spiders are my spirit animal.
wavs/audio_0337.wav|Get my back!
wavs/audio_0338.wav|Things are getting ugly.
wavs/audio_0339.wav|I need help!
wavs/audio_0340.wav|Yo! Little help.
wavs/audio_0341.wav|I can't do this alone.
wavs/audio_0342.wav|Hang back.
wavs/audio_0343.wav|Hang back!
wavs/audio_0344.wav|Look alive!
wavs/audio_0345.wav|Watch out!
wavs/audio_0346.wav|Eyes up!
wavs/audio_0347.wav|Stay sharp!
wavs/audio_0348.wav|Look alive!
wavs/audio_0349.wav|Bad thing.
wavs/audio_0350.wav|Danger!
wavs/audio_0351.wav|Stay alert!
wavs/audio_0352.wav|Babe, watch out.
wavs/audio_0353.wav|I don't see 'em.
wavs/audio_0354.wav|They're gone.
wavs/audio_0355.wav|Enemy missing.
wavs/audio_0356.wav|Can't find them.
wavs/audio_0357.wav|Enemy missing.
wavs/audio_0358.wav|Lost visual.
wavs/audio_0359.wav|They vanished.
wavs/audio_0360.wav|Stay alive!
wavs/audio_0361.wav|Bringing the pain!
wavs/audio_0362.wav|En route.
wavs/audio_0363.wav|Here I come!
wavs/audio_0364.wav|On my way.
wavs/audio_0365.wav|I'm on the move.
wavs/audio_0366.wav|Here I come!
wavs/audio_0367.wav|Headed to ya!
wavs/audio_0368.wav|I'm on the move.
wavs/audio_0369.wav|Keep it together!
wavs/audio_0370.wav|On my way.
wavs/audio_0371.wav|On it.
wavs/audio_0372.wav|You got it!
wavs/audio_0373.wav|Babe, get 'em!
wavs/audio_0374.wav|That one!
wavs/audio_0375.wav|You want it?
wavs/audio_0376.wav|Rakan, slap this fool for me!
wavs/audio_0377.wav|Deal with them!
wavs/audio_0378.wav|Take 'em down!
wavs/audio_0379.wav|Feathers fly!
wavs/audio_0380.wav|We gotta go.
wavs/audio_0381.wav|Why not?
wavs/audio_0382.wav|Don't leave without me!
wavs/audio_0383.wav|You going somewhere?
wavs/audio_0384.wav|Xayah out.
wavs/audio_0385.wav|Wait for me!
wavs/audio_0386.wav|Well, I'm bored.
wavs/audio_0387.wav|I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where.
wavs/audio_0388.wav|Bored now.
wavs/audio_0389.wav|Aw, you're looking out for me!
wavs/audio_0390.wav|Thank you, honey!
wavs/audio_0391.wav|Thanks, babe!
wavs/audio_0392.wav|Appreciate it!
wavs/audio_0393.wav|Thank you!
wavs/audio_0394.wav|Thank you!
wavs/audio_0395.wav|Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet.
wavs/audio_0396.wav|Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet.
wavs/audio_0397.wav|Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it.
wavs/audio_0398.wav|Death was a nice vacation from the tedium, but nothing good can last, I suppose.
wavs/audio_0399.wav|I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit.
wavs/audio_0400.wav|You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan.
wavs/audio_0401.wav|If we do this right, only one of us get shot.
wavs/audio_0402.wav|Get out there and take a bullet for me. Like a gentleman.
wavs/audio_0403.wav|Don't embarrass me.
wavs/audio_0404.wav|How am I supposed to work with— whatever this is?
wavs/audio_0405.wav|Block the hits for me. Please?
wavs/audio_0406.wav|Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?
wavs/audio_0407.wav|I'm insulted? I don't know.
wavs/audio_0408.wav|I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged.
wavs/audio_0409.wav|Say that to my feathers.
wavs/audio_0410.wav|Watch your tongue… and your back.
wavs/audio_0411.wav|Ouch. I'm gonna need some aloe.
wavs/audio_0412.wav|I can't even— I don't know where to begin.
wavs/audio_0413.wav|I will punch your soul in the face.
wavs/audio_0414.wav|Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood.
wavs/audio_0415.wav|The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death.
wavs/audio_0416.wav|Can I just hate you to death?
wavs/audio_0417.wav|I'm gonna murder you a thousand times.
wavs/audio_0418.wav|Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on.
wavs/audio_0419.wav|I'm about to ruin your day.
wavs/audio_0420.wav|Please, for the sake of us both, go far away.
wavs/audio_0421.wav|Rebellions thrive on intelligence.
wavs/audio_0422.wav|I never walk into a trap unprepared.
wavs/audio_0423.wav|See the enemy, know their mind.
wavs/audio_0424.wav|Sometimes, I have to watch my own back.
wavs/audio_0425.wav|I need a strategic viewpoint.
wavs/audio_0426.wav|Eyeball in the grass.
wavs/audio_0427.wav|Let's have a look-see, shall we?
wavs/audio_0428.wav|I must know their every move.
wavs/audio_0429.wav|This is ambush territory.
wavs/audio_0430.wav|I hate surprises… unless I'm doing the surprising.
wavs/audio_0431.wav|Alright, get down.
wavs/audio_0432.wav|Yeah, c'mere.
wavs/audio_0433.wav|Aw, yeah, come on.
wavs/audio_0434.wav|I can never resist an invitation to dance.
