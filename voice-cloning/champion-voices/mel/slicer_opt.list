Mel_Original_FirstEncounterJayce.wav|mel|en|Vi… When you try to please everyone,no oneis satisfied.
Mel_Original_FirstEncounterJinx.wav|mel|en|You claim to desire 'peace'; but it seems our definition may differ.
Mel_Original_FirstEncounterLeBlanc.wav|mel|en|What is it that you hope to accomplish?
Mel_Original_FirstEncounterLux.wav|mel|en|I suggest you reconsider! There's no reason for you to suffer.

Mel_Original_KillJinx.wav|mel|en|Another malefactor subdued.
Mel_Original_KillLeBlanc.wav|mel|en|Call it 'magical intervention'.
Mel_Original_KillLux.wav|mel|en|Nothing I couldn't handle.
Mel_Original_KillPenta.wav|mel|en|You were in over your head.
Mel_Original_KillSenna.wav|mel|en|This conflict was beyond your comprehension.
