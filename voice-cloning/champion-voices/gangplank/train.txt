I'll come back stronger.
Their bodies will choke the abyss.
I see corpses waiting to drop.
Pistols or blades, don't matter to me.
You haven't seen blood yet.
Their tears will salt the ocean!
Crying won't do any good.
They have no concept of misery.
Hack their kidneys out.
I'll take my time with 'em.
Paint the docks in their blood.
My heart is iron.
Bones'll splinter.
I will carve my name in their skulls.
Thisismercy in Bilgewater!
Blade to bone, that's the way.
Feed 'em their fingers.
One slash, ear to ear.
Toss 'em to the sharks.
Dead men tellmytale.
Killing's the only way to survive.
Sometimes you gotta get your hands bloody.
Blood begets blood.
This is a flayin' tool.
This blade's got bite!
Sharp enough to etch bone.
A dirty blade for a dirty job.
Nothing cuts dirtier than Bilgewater steel.
Forged in blood and bile.
Always have a shiv at the ready.
Watch 'em twitch.
A captain can't have any blind spots.
An all-purpose artefact.
Got every angle covered.
Three in a row!
Combo!
Fish in a barrel!
That's a chain!
Line 'em up!
Barrel!
Another!
More powder!
Burn!
You will never have a grave, Graves... see, it's 'cause your name, it's... your name is like a grave, it's — I — never mind.
You talk a lot for a dead man, Graves.
Only thing worse than a traitor is a bad shot.
I don't need a good hand to see your fate.
They're not just oranges. They'rebloodoranges.
I'm back at the helm.
Yar ha har argh! — (coughs) — Had something in my throat.
I've got it this time!
Will your partner try to avenge you? I hope so.
You will never have a grave, Graves.
Can't light cigars in the bottom of the sea.
Some bounties aren't worth taking, Fortune.
I don't leave anything to fortune any more.
Can't wear the crown till the king's dead, little girl.
Maybe your cards will mourn you.
The seafloor is littered with your ilk, gambler.
Sealed your fate when you crossed me, boy.
They took my ship, I'll take their lives.
With sword and shot I'll take my island back.
My flesh will never burn.
Never trust a bilgerat!
A reckoning approaches.
Mercy sank with my ship.
Cruelty for all.
I'll burn it all down if I can't have it.
Betrayal stings like salt on a wound.
A slit throat is too painless.
I rarely forget, and never forgive.
I'll take back what's mine!
My vengeance will be bloody.
Words mean nothing. Flesh carries weight.
Tides of dead will herald my return!
The sea has no memory. But I do.
Hang 'em from the Slaughter Docks.
The seas and men betray.
I lost my ship, but not my soul.
A turned back deserves a knife.
I found my hate in the fire.
I am reborn of salt and brine.
Death spit me out.
Do I look like a patient man?
A slow death will be their reward.
Hate is a child's word.
I'll hack my way back to Bilgewater.
Scum!
Everyone pays!
Filth!
I'll hit 'em with everything!
All cannons!
I'll rain fire upon 'em!
They'll have reason to run!
Powder'll get 'em moving!
Charge beneath the barrage!
Load up the hull buster!
Main cannon at the ready!
Heavy artillery for these cowards!
Broadside!
Cannons!
Volley fire!
Bathe 'em in iron!
I'll come back stronger.
I'm far from done killing.
Don't get comfortable in my absence.
Come, test yourself in the fire!
The smell of powder sets my blood to boil.
Survive this, and you'll need a lot of rum.
The flames are calling.
Always watch your back.
Keep a weather eye out.
Trust nothing to chance.
No chance!
How they try!
Not today!
Never!
That's better.
Needed that.
Hits the spot.
Neither the flames nor the depths could claim me.
