This belongs in a museum. - So do you. Nazis... I hate these guys...

Hey, your loss. But I get it.
The uglier the monster, the more fun they are to shoot.
Stand back! Let an expert handle this.
Pick a timestream, kid.
Hey Garen! How's your sister?
Heh, this is so us! Right, Lux?
This is flirty fighting.
Aim for the legs...
I'm gonna send you back to... wherever Yordles come from.
Leave Lux alone, Zoe!
I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Tell me the odds, I dare you!
No time to waste!
Another day, another bullseye.
I'll handle this!
Time for a true display of skill.
All part of the adventure.
No sweat.
Watch and learn!
Obstacle, meet gauntlet.
Hard work? Not today!
I'm a professional.
I'll make this look easy.
Hah! I can blink and still not miss.
You're between me and glory.
Haha, I'm allergic to caution.
Magic? Comin' at you.
Oh-ho! It is so on.
No problems here!
Gauntlet, let's clear a path.
This is really worth ten times the asking price.
Can I get an itemized receipt? My accountant's way too good at his job.
Nice. You can send the bill to my uncle's museum.
Are you not intrigued?
Lot of good mages out there! None of them are this hot!
Over here!
Now I'm here!
Oh, a little girl! There's gotta be a twist. *gasps* It's the teddy bear, isn't it?!
Oh, cool. Great. They have an Ascended. This should be fun.
Hey, Ashe. I totally meant to return that Avarosan sculpture thingy. Is that an ice bow? That's a cool ice bow.
A celestial dragon that throws stars. Well, this is totally normal. I can do this.
Everyone! Watch your coin purses!
Possession is 9/10ths of the law, Caitlyn. Those pre-Zaunite demon totems are mine fair and square.
Okay, Camille. Fork over thatBrackernCrystal.
Woo! Strong goggles game, Corki. Keep it up.
Darkin? We're gonna need a bigger army!
Jarro Lightfeather doesn't do autographs. Sorry.
Listen, I have met exactly one Demacian I've liked. By the way, has Lux mentioned me at all? Just curious.
Oh, okay, demigods! Well, universe, you seem to really want to screw with old Ezreal today!
Oh, please, we gotta deal withdemigods?!I really need to up my rate.
Demons? This is a job for Jarro Lightfeather.
Aw, crap, I opened a mirror dimension again! ...Does my hair really look like that?
Giantpetricitegargoyle. So it's gonna be one of those kind of days.
Hey, brainface, you are why no one likes Yordle inventors.
Can't manufacture magic in a lab, Jayce! Or good looks, for that matter.
That mask is not art, Jhin. It's ancient history.
Nope! I did not sign up for Jinx-level crazy.
Hey, Lamb... is Wolf friendly?
Oh, I've heard of theBlack Rose. Nasty reputation... I mean, uh, huge fan!
Lucian! It's me... Jarro Lightfeather.
I'm a mage. You're a mage. I'm blond. You're blonde. Doesn't it feel like we're made for each other?
Hey, Lux! *clears throat* Hey, Lux. What're yah up to later? Let's hang.
Don't pretend you didn't see me, Lux. That doesn't work.
Hi, honey! Is it too soon to call you honey? It's too soon.
Why is it always about strength with Noxians? How about vulnerability for once?
Can you forge me a matching gauntlet?
Heh! Piltovans! Always think they're the center of the universe.
Well, you are just terrifying, aren't you, Pyke?
So... Rakan. How serious are you and Xayah? Just asking.
What the heck is that?!
Hey, Ryze! Are you still hiding all those dangerous runes in one place? (louder) Should I not yell that?
Shadow Isles... all that Black Mist has got to be protecting something really valuable.
Shurimans. Always thinking I appropriated their cultural heritage. They're not wrong.
Oh, c'mon! Sivir! I swear, I didn't know I was robbing your family's ossuary!
Throw some more rocks, Taliyah! I need targets to shoot!
Targonians... Hey, ten words or less, what exactly are you guys?
Yeah, I get it. It's tough being handsome. Right, Taric?
Didn't expect unliving ghouls. Note to self: always expect unliving ghouls.
Vastaya! Just like inSantangelo's field guide!
Well hello, Xayah. You should know that I am pro-Vastayan rights.
Hey, Xerath! How come you didn't get a cool Ascended animal body?
Gahh, I'm too young for you, Zoe. Cradle-robber.
Zoe, you're ruining my chances with Lux!
Time to show 'em who's best. Spoiler: it's me.
Don't make me put my goggles on. They're decorative.
Hey there, gauntlet!  How ya doin', buddy?
Do I wear my gauntlet... or does my gauntlet wear me?
Ah. Watch this...  We will never speak of this again. Ever.
There's somewhere else I gotta be. Literally anywhere else.
This is no time for jokes. Your jokes. My jokes are great.
Never act like victory is assured. Even though it probably is.
No applause, please! ...Okay, maybe just a bit of thunderous acclaim! ...A little?
That escalated quickly.
Good job, everyone. Let's, uh... just keep doing whatever you were doing.
Cool guys never look back at explosions.
Oooh, I hope that wasn't a world heritage site.
I'll come back later and sift through the rubble for artifacts.
Everyone see that? No? Damn! Now I've got to go and do it again!
They just don't make temple traps like they used to.
Name's Ezreal. E-Z-... oh, you're dead.
And Ezreal is victorious!Ahhh! Yeah!
Take five, everyone. I got this.
I don't care where here is. Just point me toward adventure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. World. Peril. Save it. I got it, I got it.
Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere...
Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory... girls are watching.
Stick with me and you'll be fine. That's not a guarantee, by the way.
Oh, please don't die. I can't lose a sidekick. Not again.
Hey. We can do this! Well, I can do this. You, 50/50.
This reminds me of discovering the spirit tomb of Ekrin.
I always know a shortcut.
A beaten path is a boring path.
No way to predict the twists and turns ahead. That's why I wing it!
Never met a problem I couldn't blast away with magic... that I don't even understand.
I use a fake name in Demacia: Jarro Lightfeather.Sentinel of Light, 8th Order. He's a national hero.
They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice.
I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet.
It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do... *cough* not have a college degree.
Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great.
I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? ...Don't answer that.
Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it.
I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself.
Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was... not pretty.
Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something's impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it.
Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a... jackal head, end of times... the usual. I just wanted this ruby scarab. It looked great on my mantle.
Ugh... water's cold. AHH! Something touched my foot!
...And my boots are not waterproof. Fantastic.
I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good.
I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it.
There's an unspoken law in archaeology: finders keepers.
Sounds dangerous. I'm in.
True explorers follow the compass in their heart.
I'm always open to new ideas. My new ideas.
If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?
I. Never. Miss. But I have been known to fire a warning shot or two...
I hate the word 'steal.' I prefer 'liberate' or 'procure.'
Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty.
Exploration runs in my family. It's in my blood.
No plan survives first contact with me.
Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule.
Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me.
Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those.
Once it's a ruin, I can legally loot it.
I'm at my best when the world's on the brink of annihilation.
Who needs a map?
The gauntlet's for show... the talent's all me.
Heha!
Ha!
Gawk atthis!
Marvel atthat!
Blast 'em, gauntlet!
Maybe next time I'll open an eye.
That's what skill feels like. Hurts, doesn't it?
Oooh, that looked like it hurt.
Nice shot, me. High-five.
Can't learn that in a textbook.
That was a, uh... that was a warning shot!
I blame the terrain. Totally that rock's fault.
Must've ricocheted off a cricket or... something...
It wasn't a miss. It was a... near-hit.
Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
We mages call this a warlock exit.
Ancient. Magic. Words.
Relax. I blindly teleport long distances all the time!
Alright, guys. Don't miss me too much.
Whoa. Time out, everyone! Don't continue the fight without me!
Don't attempt anything glorious in my absence.
Back from the dead? That confirms it. I am a god.
Megamind.
I'll be omitting that little mishap from the expedition logs.
I truly hope nobody saw that.
If anyone asks, I didn't see any of these priceless artifacts for sale.
This belongs in a museum. - So do you. Nazis... I hate these guys...
Don't worry, I'm not the magic artifact police. Wait, are you?
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What are your weak spots again?
Sick burn... probably? Wasn't listening.
Call me when the stakes are higher.
Yeah!
Quest accepted! ...Wait, where are we going?
