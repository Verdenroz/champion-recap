wavs/audio_0001.wav|Hmph. Tragic.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|You call yourself a dragon? You're low-flame at best.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Low dragon, unfitting of the name.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|A dragon that still needs wings to fly? Keep trying, you'll get there.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I never bite. Too uncouth.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Suns never burn for the benefit of dust.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Return to dust!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|What a pity.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Think cosmic... like this!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Boring me is dangerous.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Admire... then die!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Be useful. Be stardust. I'll help.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Too bad.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I'm going to throw a star at you now. Good luck.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Defending yourself? Adorably futile.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Irritating cluster of particles.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I tried to like you.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Impending doom. Exciting, isn't it?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|You are woefully underprepared.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Defenses? Laughable.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I'll indulge your foolhardy nature.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Live through this, and we'll chat.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Lighten up, destruction needn't be a maudlin affair.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|You are more useful as dust.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Plenty more to come.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Not everyone shines brightly enough!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Illuminate.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Oh, youwillshine.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|To atoms!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Tedious being.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Be brighter. I'll help.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Dragon's breath it is.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Uselessandintolerable. Charming.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Bravery is absurd, but admirable.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Why would I spare such mediocrity?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Melt.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Smolder, then implode!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Congratulations, you have earned my contempt.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|They are merely dust.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Youwillknow your place.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Nothing a little star fire cannot fix.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|A snow globe? Perfect for my collect—to destroy you.Destroy you!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Liandry's torment... my benefit.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Perfect for the bi-millennial celestial masquerade ball.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|IfBardandKindredcan pull off wearing a mask, so can I.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|There are no echoes where I'm from.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|So many magic staves.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|But a shadow of sound.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Hats are always fashionable.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|As long as it's set at a jaunty angle, I'm in.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|A bit gaudy for my tastes but exceedingly useful.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Time to slow things down a bit.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Shiny, but it's no star.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I tend to burn through footwear.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|My feet rarely touch the ground.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Pay? Do you know who I am?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Fine, take your gold...
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Just... my... style.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Put it on my tab. The name's Pantheon, with a P.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Good find.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Money? How barbaric.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Put it on Mount Targon's tab.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Join me in the dance cosmic!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Let's dance!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Hello, Runeterra! Are you ready torock?
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Never said I was infallible...
wavs/audio_0067.wav|The brightest stars shine on long after they're gone...
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Left an exquisite corpse.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Alas, I am simply too beautiful for this world.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Anyone want some stardust?
wavs/audio_0071.wav|My, how they stare.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Now we're playing with star fire!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Feels good to make things again!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|This'll make them stare.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Stellar!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Accrete!
wavs/audio_0077.wav|You aspire to be human!? Oh, darling, there are so many other variants on mediocrity!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I amoverwhelmedby an emotion when you are not around. It is called... happiness.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Mages are infants grasping at the machinery behind reality. At leastyouhave a plausible excuse.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|YouAscendedcertainly know how to pick an animal totem.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Your immortality is but a grain of sand in time's vast desert.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Were you born this flat, or did you work at it?
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Pick a dimension, Bard, you're confusing them!
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The funnier the hat, the greater the prestige, right?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Runeterra. Am I right?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|If dunking is the apex of this primitive sport, then I am the queen of space.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|It is always a moon's role to envy the stars.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|You and Leona embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|You're out of your league.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|You would make an interesting dragon.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Made a mistake? Better rewind and repeat until you achieve mediocrity.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Fear? Generic.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Idealism? Hilariously outdated.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Rage? Cute.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Gunpowder and metal sticks? Enchanting.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Humanity, surprisingly adept in the art of wrestling survival from the clutches of extinction.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|As far as fauna goes, humans strike a firm... middle.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Ah, mankind. Ever fumbling from one brink of cataclysm to the next.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I've seen the main act. You're only a third-rate cover band.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|You do not understand yourgod, Illaoi.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Imagine what you could do with a larger canvas.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Life is short, go crazy once in a while, I get it.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|The sun?Thissun? Oh, darling.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|You and Diana embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|All dazzle, no brilliance.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|There is a saying on this planet: 'dumb as a rock.' It's not a compliment.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Youare going to killme? Dressed like that?
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Bravo, Nasus, you've ascended yourself into a dog! Now fetch me something more interesting.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Icouldteach an old dog millions of new tricks, but I simply don't like you, Nasus.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Your fate was sealed the moment you picked up Targon's spear.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Are you burdened by your own monotony? Because I am.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|That whole practice of Ascension is adorably amusing, like a kitten trying to walk upright.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|True magic is beyond language. Writing merely butchers the intent.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Magic tattoos? Where did you get those, magic prison? ...Oh.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Ah, Ryze, I see you've brought paper to take notes.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Medium flame, and that is me being generous.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Almost interesting. Almost.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Darling, you have but set my hearts free.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|A dragon's loyalty is a priceless gift. Do not waste it in the service of fools.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Unfitting of the draconic lineage.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Twinkle, twinkle, little star... do you wonder what you are?
wavs/audio_0122.wav|The heavens drag on endlessly, much like a conversation with you.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I will cauterize Targon with star fire.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|The Aspect of Targon? Sparks masquerading as lightning.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|You're anAspect? Let me guess... tackiness.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Oh, come on, have a little self-respect!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Galaxies exist by my will... but, yes, that is certainly an impressive sword.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|You are going to punch a star dragon. Good luck with that.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Hm. Punching?
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Blood magic? How tragically primitive.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I empathize with your life as a weapon, but have alittlebackbone.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|You bend time the way a child folds origami—cute, but nothing special.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Hm...
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Mmm...
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Hmm...
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Which star is your favorite? I made that one.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Of course I love Runeterra! You have buildings and... more buildings.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|A sun is unimaginable celestial power, and thrilled mortals use theirs to coordinate this 'lunch time.'
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Few can impress me. That is a compliment.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Runeterra? I mean the name of this world literally means 'magic earth.'
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I made the stars, but you... inspire me to make more.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I make entropy look good.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|First you start with some matter, then add star fire and voilà! It basically does the rest itself.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|You may look forward to more of this.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|That ought to keep them talking for the next century or so.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Cosmic dragon: 5. Everyone else: 0. Please, take notes.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Well, that was easy.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Boop.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Boop.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Boop.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Nothingtheybuild can endure like the celestial firmament.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|The architects of these towers misunderstand object permanence.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|How many must I knock down before they learn?
wavs/audio_0154.wav|All towers fall. It's just what they do when I'm around.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Topple, like all things crafted by mortals.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Towers tend to crumble when I am in the vicinity.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|My wish upon a star came true.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I shall inscribe this moment in the stars.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Never stop when you're on a roll.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|The stars were not in their favor.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|I guess their fate was written in the stars.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Starstruck?
wavs/audio_0163.wav|The stars weep for you. Just kidding, I already forgot your name.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Nice job, just standing there.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Wrong orbit. Wrong time.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Stars are best viewed from a distance.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|In a constantly shifting cosmos, a world this static is... refreshing.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Cower, worship, beg, they're all valid reactions.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|There simply are no other dragons like me.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Hope. Wonder. Insignificance. Imagine what they'll feel when I complete the stars.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|They call me a comet. They call me a dragon. They have no words for my true form.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Why does anyone wish upon a star?
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Perhaps there is more to this world than I thought... not much, but enough.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|My stars shine for all.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Only when darkness overwhelms the heavens will Targon realise its folly.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|I see a universe drained of light and heat, where not even a story will survive.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|I've waited millennia to watch Targon fall.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|The stories they tell about me? They're probably true.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Targon will be the pyre from which I forge a new heaven.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Stars are wonder and love ignited.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|The heavens diminish without my attention.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Nothing kindles wonder like the beauty of stars.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|This sun could do with a new core.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|This world holds the key toTargon'sundoing.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|My home is in the cosmos, amongst my stars.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Allterrestrial dragonsare but pale imitations of my kind.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Celestial dragonslive and die by our own beautiful rules.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Sometimes, the stars gaze back.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Each star is one of my hearts.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|I wouldn't navigate by the stars. They are a work in progress.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|This sun is off its axis. It's been driving me crazy for eons now.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|I would burn the cosmos to catch Targon in the flames.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Planetary life... the insufferable byproduct of dim stars.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Darkness is my only true enemy.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Any relevant species has been knocked back into the Stone Age once or twice.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I kindled the furnaces of wonder.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|With a few more basic elements I could really make this place shimmer.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Stars never align for anyone... except me, of course.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Wherever I am is the fashionable part of the universe. Even here.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Stars are not born, they are made... by me.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|I spark passion into star fire.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|There are countless colors, but I suppose a single rainbow is a good start.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|The stars are not to thank for any 'good luck' one may experience.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Targon's magic is crude, but potent.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|I grieve for every star never born.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|As Targon's influence wanes, mine grows.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Whenever I think my work is complete, I end up back here, under this sun.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|The depths of space crawl with terrible entities. Pray they ignore this world.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|A star's birth is as violent as it is breathtaking.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|A star is so much more than a luminous sphere of wonder.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|My works are revered by worlds I have never even visited.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Targon has used me as its weapon for far too long.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|All beings are made of the same stardust.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|If you ask me, we have set the bar too low for sentience.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|And I'm barely trying!
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Pure star fire!
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Another mass extinction, so soon?
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Let's end this on a high note!
wavs/audio_0219.wav|It's beyond too late to seek cover.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|This will be quite the deadly spectacle.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|My sphere of influence grows.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Expanding my horizons.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Time for a great expansion.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Always know when to make an entrance... and an exit.
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Don't miss me too much.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|I've seen enough.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Always leave them begging for more.
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Because I am a star dragon. That's why.
wavs/audio_0229.wav|It's not a comeback if one was never truly gone.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Stars never fall.
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Energy never dies.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|With a lifespan as comically brief as yours, I suppose I can allow you to taste triumph at least once.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|Hello again. Let's have some fun.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Your demise will be sung about for ages to come... only thanks to its proximity to me, of course.
wavs/audio_0235.wav|What is the definition of underwhelming? Oh, right! You.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|I shall be the last thing you see. Lucky you.
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Make a wish. See if the stars answer. I'll wait.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|I used to wander the stars. Now I'm stuck down here, with you.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|On other worlds, there is emerging life more complex than you.
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Your survival is not impossible, only very...very...very unlikely.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Never stand in the path of a star.
wavs/audio_0242.wav|Time to give them a show.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Time to gather the necessary matter.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|None shall tread upon the stars.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Naturally.
