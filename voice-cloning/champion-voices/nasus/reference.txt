Do not try my patience.
Soon, there will be nothing.
Your spirit is hollow.
Return to the dust.
We approach a time of reckoning.
Bellicòni, ti piacciono icòni?
Death is a harsh mistress.
This too must end.
Some spirits are fated to burn.
Journey into the beyond.
I bring death.
Life is part of a cycle. Yours is over.
Eternity is beyond your reach.
Anthropomancy: divination by entrails.
Renekton was lost, long ago. You are but his pale shadow.
Your legacy shall drift away; blown into eternity, like the sands of the desert.
Rage burned away all that was good in you, my brother.
No, I will not fetch the ball.
Who let the dogs out? Woof. Woof. Woof.
My bite is worse than my bark.
Burdens sleep best in their tombs.
For centuries, I have watched.
Between life and death lies immortality.
The past is a tapestry of what lies ahead.
Some things must remain buried.
I walk through the ages.
Shurima is not of this time.
Eons... pass like days.
Errant words may fell empires.
Do not try my patience.
It is never ending.
No dawn comes without darkness.
Perhaps Shurima was meant to fall.
Their death, awaits.
The sky is naught but dying stars.
Your legacy shall drift away; blown into eternity, like the sands of the desert.
There is such potential in one mortal life; you have wasted yours.
Become dust.
Perish.
Wither.
Waste away.
The cycle of life and death continues. We will live, they will die.
