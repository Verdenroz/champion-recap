Oh, I knew you was all yeller!
Dang nabbit, you're gonna get us killed!
Easy, girl, easy!
Calm down, girl!
Skaarl, I got this!
No Skaarl, no! Bad Skaarl!
Don't get your britches all rumpled!
Don't get weird on me!
Quit your worryin'!
Whoa! Whoa! Don't get excited, now!
Whoa, Skaarl, whoa!
Don't you run off on me! Skaarl!
Calm down, you damn-!
See, Skaarl? I don't need help!
I'll kick the crap outta you!
I'll say something witty after I kill you!
I'm gonna cut you open and use your spine for a back scratcher, because it is itchy! Very itchy!
My brain is full of weasels!
My blood is piss and vinegar!
Now you done it!
I'm gonna reach down your throat, and turn your lungs into mittens!
You's trying my patience!
I'm through running!
Oh, you prancing bastard!
I'm gonna make you wish you were a hallucination!
I'll kill 'em all!
Skaarl! You're missing the fun!
I hate you!
You're a cockroach, and it's half-past stomping time!
Intruder!
My axe talks for me!
I can only express myself through violence!
There's fixing to be two sounds: me hitting you, and---
I ain't stopping!
I'm just beginning to fight!
300
Who sent you?
Welcome to Noxus!
You thought I was done? Kled ain't never done!
You see, Skaarl? I'm doing it alone!
Come back here and fight!
No trespassing!
Seinfeld
I can't be reasoned with!
You think I don't hear you laughing?
I don't like sharing!
I'll kill you!
I'll gut you!
I am the brutal instrument of my own destiny!
No-one tells me what to do.
Lord Colonel Major Centurion Kled don't run, no he don't!
I don't need a team to start a teamfight!
I don't need that lizard! Kled's got his own ideas.
Skaarl! Come back, buddy! Skaarl?
I know that lizard ain't talking, but I still hear him. Shut up, lizard. Shut up!
Oh, she'll see, she'll see! She'll come strolling back when I turn them interlopers into a purée.
I said I wasn't not backing off, no how!
This world is rough. You gotta be tough or die.
I don't need you Skaarl!
Yes, a sane man would run, but I ain't the running kind!
This here land is mine!
Damnit, Skaarl! I hate walking!
Stop talking, you stupid brain badgers!
Why's all these intruders so far away?
Sure! I'll kill all of them myself!
Even if I lose, I win! Just means I get to come back and kill you later!
First thing you learn as a Lieutenant Sergeant Commodore: rely only on yourself.
Ain't nobody gonna give you nothing. Gotta take it yourself.
Impossible ain't a Noxian word.
I didn't become a Rear Forward Brigadier Admiral from running!
I know you're listening, brain weasels! I ain't falling for it!
This is just a victory waiting to happen!
What was that? Run straight into the tower?
I am Sir Admiral Major Kled, and I smell a victory potpourri!
Hey, what was that? Of course I don't need Skaarl… but he helps.
This desert sky's gonna open up with a rain of heavenly bloodshed and glorious violence!
Folks say I got violent tendencies.
I didn't not earn the rank of Sergeant double Admiral by not running!
Ain't nobody tough as Kled! I've got gravel in my guts and a fire in my head!
I came here to… well, I don't know what I came here for, but I'm gonna defend it!
Skaarl! Skaarl!
Yip yip!
Hee hee!
Get 'em!
Whoa!
Wahah!
Wowee!
Woo!
Yeehaw!
Yah!
Woo!
Get 'em, Skaarl!
Ha-ha!
Hyaah!
Ha!
Drinking from battle? What kind of dumb crap is that?
Telling people you're a god? Hell, you're barely a paring knife.
Something caught in your throat? 'cause you sound desperate!
You know, I like you, brother. As much as I can like a lily-livered jungle-sniffer.
Watch your stepping! That's my land you're gallivanting on!
You sure you're Noxian? You look a little Ionian to me.
Don't mess with Noxus, brother.
You may be from Noxus, but you ain't Noxian.
I got a joke too! It's called me kicking your teeth in!
So, that's what considered funny in the city, huh?
Real funny! Knew a funny guy in the Drekan Campaign—took a javelin in the spine, couldn't walk after that. Used him as a coat rack.
Was you making fun of my Skaarl?
That it? That was your joke, huh?
And he ain't even had the indignity to call himself a demon.
Never had much to say, but I'm sure glad we shut him up.
He died as dumb as he sounded.
I guess it's snake dinner tonight!
I mean, before we killed her. Snake for legs? Crazy!
Girl was all messed up.
Was that lady half-snake, or that snake half-human? She is… confusing. Dead, but confusing.
Hey, lizard food! What exactly was you general of?
Death bymyhand!
He wanted to unify Noxus. Guess that makes me a secessionist.
KLEEEEEED… naw, it's just Kled.
This is where Kled shines!
Who wants some Kled?
And you thought I talked crazy!
I gotta stop the mushroom juice… I swear that girl had some tentacles or something!
Skaarl? You eatin' good tonight! That girl's got some meat on her!
Hey, fancy pants! Got your cloak dirty!
I don't know what he was. I just needed him to shut up.
Bye bye, fancy pants!
I can respect crazy, but what kind of fool reloads in the middle of a fight?
Humans is such easy prey.
I like a girl with moxie.
A sinister blade? Heck, girl, Skaarl's got farts more sinister than you was.
No, obviously she didn't have any! That's the darn point!
Yeah, I'll try it on later.
She had one crazy getup! Them city-folk clothes is getting ridiculous.
All your little city-girl dreams just got stomped.
Go back to Noxus Prime!
Queen of what? Darn thing made Skaarl look smart!
We wrecked that thing!
Damn varmint left holes all over the yard.
Seems to have lost your bounce, girl.
All that hippy hop! Getting on my nerves!
Pure Noxian girl. Almost liked her. Almost.
I know!
How many times do I gotta kill him?
He looks a little overripe.
I don't think you can eat that one.
Huh. I liked him better when he was alive.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
Tactician? More like bird brain.
Master Tactician? He can keep that title.
I figure he gonna taste like chicken.
Sure!
He gonna taste good deep-fried.
Well, that shut him up!
Finally, some silence.
I knew he was a liar, 'cause he used them big words.
Let that be a lesson for all them sneaky-sneaks!
Another dead city boy, thinking he could sneaky-sneak on my land.
I've seem some dumb outfits, Skaarl, but a cape made out of knives? Woo, ha! That took the cake!
Hey cous', glad you came to visit!
A relative's just another unwanted guest.
Just 'cause we was kin don't mean I ain't feeding you to Skaarl!
I could feel bad about killing you, or we could stomp on your corpse!
You ain't cute now!
Aw, you are so cute… 'fore I ripped your fuzzy head off!
You was cute—lousy, but cute.
Afraid I had to cut your visit short.
Y'all made a nice stabbing bag.
Next time you visit, bring more stuff I can take!
Skaarl, that was what we call a predictable scenario.
They never learn.
I might be a deranged lizard-riding bandito, but I whooped you real good!
We didn't come here to teach lessons in humanity!
Killing makes me thirsty.
Tried to bushwhack a bushwhacker!
That'll learn 'em!
Ahahahaha! I warned him! I did warn him!
It's funny, 'cause he died right on the border of my land, and more of my land!
Nothing like a river of blood to send a message.
This is Noxus, son! Winner takes all!
Now, I might have overreacted to you unlawfully entering my property—but I don't think so!
How's that dirt taste?
Don't let the door hit you on your way to hell!
Don't worry, Skaarl! We'll come back so you can eat 'em later.
You were a visitor, now you're mulch!
Whoops! Looks like I accidentally stabbed you with my long axe—until you were dead!
That learned 'em real good.
Thought you could take my land, huh? How'd that work out for you?
Glad you could visit!
I told 'em what was gonna happen if they came onto my land!
You will salute when you address me!
You get my invitation to visit? No? 'cause there ain't one!
Let's get 'em, Skaarl!
You just justified a preemptive retaliatory strike!
How about a long axe in your guts?
Look, Skaarl! It's dinner time!
You see my welcome sign back there? No? It was your friend's skull!
Let's get 'em, 'fore they get us.
Slow down so I can kill something!
Get off my lawn!
You mocking me?
This land is my land!
Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)
Step on my land again, you're done!
I am justified, and I am armed!
Damn city folk!
I got your welcoming present right here!
Oh, it's on!
You can't bushwhack a bushwhacker!
Howdy!
The Princess Bride
Don't interrupt me! I'm trying to start a fight!
He looked at me funny! Get him.
Let's get them trespassers!
This is how it's gonna work: I kill you, then I take your stuff.
You looking at me? 'cause I'm gonna kill you!
They came looking for a fight? Let's oblige 'em.
You can't take what's mine!
I'm gonna murder you to death!
My brain is on fire, my soul is strong, and my lizard is hungry!
You are perturbing my tranquility!
Let's do it!
You should run! Skaarl likes his food lively!
They's about to be dead!
I will murder your whole family!
Only coffin's gonna be this lizard's belly!
Damn trespassers!
Why ain't they saluting me? They should be saluting me! Salute me now!
The badgers command your death!
I play with guns. I work with an axe.
Don't need a plan… long as I got this axe.
There ain't no land that ain't mine. Just land I ain't got around to claiming.
They're all trespassers, we're just killing them five first.
Oh, we find 'em, tie 'em up, then they's like a piñata full of meat.
I am deep-fried courage, and an apple pie of angry!
I grew up mean and now I'm older than murder.
No more of that! You're upsetting the invisible badgers!
Yeah, reminds me of the siege of Ruug. Lot of men died on its high walls. It was fun.
Yeah, they think they so clever! Brains don't win fights, brains is what splatter on you!
I'm from all over. It's next to nowhere andshut the hell up!
Fine, you said!
We was having a nice conversation, then they showed up… uninvited!
Nah, I'm sure it'll pass.
I keep hallucinating that you can talk.
Mushrooms are healthy! Once you get used to the madness and paranoia.
Ain't much I love. Only this big sky, and this dumb lizard.
At the gates of Qualthala, they tried using that boiling oil on us, but you can't deep-fry courage!
Of course I want to pick a fight with 'em.
Naw, it's just like the assault on Glorft. You seen one artillery vanguard in a commando fleet action, you seen 'em all.
No, I'm positive, I ain't delusional! …More than usual…
Skaarl! This ain't no time for philosophying!
Shut your hole, you dumb lizard.
Noxus ends where I say it ends.
Are you ready for anything?
Of course you are!
No, it's when I don't drink mushroom juice that I have a problem!
Killing a few things might loosen this up.
My land begins where I walk. It ends where the sun don't shine!
Shh! Them brain weasels probably listening for us.
The sky is my roof, the open plains are my bed, and this lizard is the only company I need.
Let's get some new property.
I do prefer to ride into battle.
Ain't nothing like having the wind on your back and blood on your face.
Don't you bite me again!
Just 'cause they're our team don't mean we can trust 'em.
You do come up with the best ideas.
I don't have trouble communicating. Words is just treacherous bastards.
Well, you the only thing I trust.
No! Planning and strategy? That's city-folk stuff!
Ain't nothing more beautiful than the Noxian plains… excepting a rich corpse.
It's your birthday, Skaarl! Let's bake a murder cake!
Let's get to killing them interloping intruders!
I came to cut off a piece of that Noxian dream… and I ain't sharing my piece!
Damnit Skaarl, d'you hide my mushroom juice again?
You ready, Skaarl? This day's gonna require some mindblowing weirdness.
A man without a weapon ain't worth listening to.
Hey, it's Forward Admiral Major Kled! I ain't been a Mister since ever!
What are you whining about? I already fed you half a platoon!
After we finish murdering these folks, what do you think? Tacos? Yeah, tacos.
Would you stop bitching for one minute?
I do not want my lands tamed. I want them unruly and free.
Of course I'm paranoid! You tried to kill me yesterday!
They ain't ready for us.
You can't be lonely when the land is this beautiful.
Damn cowards, making me ride over to kill 'em.
Yeah, well, that's what I thought.
I know, I know.
The Venture Bros.
Yeah, I like it out here. Freedom, communing with nature, killing hikers.
Well, just 'cause you're a hallucination and I don't speak lizard don't mean I can't understand you!
First, we kill 'em, then we make 'em tell us where they came from.
Because I know someone is trying to sneak up on us!
I fight better when I've had my… medicine.
Nah, them we kill them too! Ain't nobody on my team but you.
Yeah, but… then how we gonna invade both bases at once?
This big sky, this green land. Now how could I share this with anyone?
Shh! It's time to get violent… and weird.
This land was made for me—and me alone.
Well, maybe Iamlooking to start a fight!
Were you just talking, or was it the voices again?
Woo, it's darn pretty round here. Glad it's mine.
Was the battle of Fallgren when I first took the rank of Sergeant General Colonel. Least, I think that's what rank they was. Gotta remember to askbeforekilling them.
Remember when we sacked Trevale, and that general thought we'd be willing to share the spoils? Pheh! Officers die just as easy as anybody.
I am Kled! High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company! You will respect my authority!
All we need is open country, but we gonna take everything they got!
Yeah, they just confirming our suspicions, ain't they?
Them's humans!
Naw, they're good eatin'.
What was that? Oh, I should go for the decakill? Uh, if you say so.
It's my property! All sixty gazillion acres of it!
Guess we'll have to kill our way out!
I'll take 'em alone!
Not again!
The fighting's this way!
What are you doing?
Now I gotta walk!
No, no! The other way! Get back here!
Hey! We ain't done!
You stupid, dumb animal!
I knew you was a coward!
Get back here, you---
Where you going? We got 'em right where we want 'em!
I ain't never forgiving you, you flea-bitten-!
Fine! I'll kill 'em!
Traitor!
Darn nabbit! You lily-livered flea bucket!
Get back here you-!
Go home, get! I never needed you no how!
I will--- I ain't backing down! I don't back down! Never!
Get over here, buddy!
Woo, good timing!
Where you been?
Dang nabbit, I love this lizard!
For the brain weasels!
If you does that one more time I'll skewer you and roast you myself!
Yeah!
Boy am I glad to see you!
The badgers command it!
I knew you'd be back.
Yahoo!
Yeehaw! I knew you couldn't quit me, Skaarl!
Now we got 'em!
Wahoo!
Just try and run!
Thought you wanted to visit!
Oh, you ain't getting away!
Gotcha now!
Get back here!
You think you can run?
Gotcha!
You ain't going nowhere!
Oops, bear trap in your neck!
Come back, I gotta put an axe in your brain!
How you like that leash?
Aw, you ain't leaving, are you?
I'm gonna learn you about pain!
You ain't running!
Chaaaaarge!
No prisoneeeers!
Yaaaahoooo!
Yaaaahoooo!
Chaaaaarge!
Let's get 'em!
Yeeeehaaaw!
Yeaaaaaaah!
Follow meeeee!
Shut your mouth hole! Them badgers are listening.
Say that again! I dare you.
Thems fighting words! See, Skaarl? That's why I don't like people.
Looney Tunes
I'm just a Yordle standing in front of you, asking you toshut the hell up!
Usually I find conversation boring and useless. You remind me I'm right.
Woo, no sir, I ain't gonna kill you and feed you to my lizard! Them's just… malicious rumours!
Oh, before I forget, what, uh… rank are you, exactly?
You feel like arguing about something? It'll make what happens later easier for you.
I figure I'll help you kill 'em… before I kill you.
So… when exactly you planning on getting the hell outta here?
Don't worry, them voices ain't telling me to kill you no more…! Yeah, of course we still gonna kill 'im.
You do realise… you're on my property?
You got a purdy mouth.
I ain't paranoid—I'm ready. Real ready.
I keep my eyes open—all the time.
There's no such thing as paranoia; your worst fears can come true at any moment.
Paranoia is just another word for ignorance.
It ain't paranoia if everyoneisout to get you.
Total paranoia is just total awareness!
I know them trespassers is somewhere…
Paranoia… means having all the facts.
It's mine, and I got my eye on it!
Them sneaky-sneaks ain't gonna sneak on us, no sir!
Yeah, any of them varmints sneak up on us, we'll know.
They's always trying to sneak up on us. Trying, that is.
Axe!
Axe!
Axe!
Axe!
Stab!
Stab!
Stab!
Stab!
Vicious!
Vicious!
Vicious!
Vicious!
I find courage unpredictable. It's total insanity you can rely on!
