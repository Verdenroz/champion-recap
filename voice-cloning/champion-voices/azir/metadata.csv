wavs/audio_0001.wav|Your emperor shall return.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|No beast will stop us!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Emperors have no need of barons.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|We will overcome this monster!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|No dragon can defeat us!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Even dragons look up to the sun.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|I have no fear of dragons.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|V for Vendetta
wavs/audio_0009.wav|You dare oppose me?
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Mine is the will of Shurima.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|They dare defy Shurima?
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I will open their eyes.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|They have overstepped.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|The unworthy have no place in history.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Who denies our right to rule?
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Soon, none will question us.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Never cross an emperor.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Challenge Shurima, challenge fate.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Give yourselves to Shurima.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Ancient power courses through me.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Fate is in our hands.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Behold the desert's wrath.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|With a word, I end you.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Eventually, the sands claim us all.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Shurima will brook no offense.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|May the sands of Shurima always be under our feet.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I will shift as the sands.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Time itself serves Shurima.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|The Hunger Games
wavs/audio_0030.wav|How...?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Shurima...
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Trust in me!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|My decree is made!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|This spider will be trampled in our march.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Renekton, once a noble warrior, now naught but a mad beast.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Here, we shall decide the future of Shurima!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Rise with Shurima, Sivir, or fall beneath it.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|You are but a grain of sand, Xerath.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|The future will be written by the Ascended!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Today, you will see the power of Ascension!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|For emperors, it's all about how you carry yourself.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|So, a pigeon walks into a bar...
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Teach them to respect Ascension!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|It is your turn to carry our great legacy.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|It is you who are in my web, spider.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|This is but one step on a long and glorious path.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Shurima will know only victory.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You have forgotten yourself, Renekton.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Accept your destiny, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|You must learn respect, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Xerath, the time of your judgment has come.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|You are but my shadow, Xerath!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|You have already failed, Xerath. You must now accept it.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Xerath, it is time your spark went out.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|None shall ever question the power of Shurima!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Destiny halts for no one.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Traitor, I cast you to the winds.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Nothing is beyond my reach.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Your sacrifice is part of a greater plan.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|At last, Shurima will reach its destiny!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Let us return to our rightful place, Nasus.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|It has been a long wait Nasus... but it will be worth it.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Together, we shall strive toward victory, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|It is our right to rule, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Emperors have no rivals, Xerath. Only liabilities.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|The world is a desert. I am the oasis.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Shurima will once again stretch to the horizon.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|It is my time. Put your faith in me.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Shurima is where all paths converge.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I will guide us to glory.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|We are the authors of history.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|All eyes look to us.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|We walk a path of radiance.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|This slumbering world must awaken.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|You need not follow, but you must witness.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Loyalty will be rewarded.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|No sacrifice is too great.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Believe in our future.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|There is no future without Shurima.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|We will unearth what has been lost.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Those who follow me follow destiny.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|The power of the sun lives in Shurima.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|A ruler must choose his hour.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The Ascended shall guide humanity to greatness.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I am Shurima's dawn.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Shurima's legacy will endure.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|None know the will of the desert better than I.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|My empire lives in every grain of sand.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|We are made by our choices.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Everyone will know the name Shurima.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Join me, and be elevated.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Shurima lives in me.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I will return Shurima to greatness.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Rise again!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Arise.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Return.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|An idol of greatness.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|My city lives on.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|You cannot topple Shurima.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Return from the sands.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Shurima is never lost.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Return!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I claim this for Shurima!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Serve me!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|This is Shuriman land.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Arise!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Recognize your emperor.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|This now serves Shurima.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Conquer!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Kill.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I am Ascended.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Shurima is eternal.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Glory to Shurima!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|My soldiers march on.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Your emperor shall return.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I will reclaim my stolen legacy!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|You need not follow me, but you cannot stop me.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Like the sun, Shurima always rises!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The bounty of Shurima still flows.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I will be reborn.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Emperors never die.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I am testament to the glory of Shurima!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|When every trace of you is lost, I will remain.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|What is the desert, but the ashes of my enemies?
wavs/audio_0125.wav|There is only Shurima. All else is but a mirage.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Trust in my vision.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I am Shurima's vision.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|The light of Shurima.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Soldiers, onward!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Bury them.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|The order is given!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Shurima! Your emperor has returned!
