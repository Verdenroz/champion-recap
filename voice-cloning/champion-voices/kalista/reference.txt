All things have consequence.
You shall be avenged.
Your killers will be punished.
We shall bring your killers to their knees.
You share in our success.
You strengthen us.
We will remember your loyalty.
Our will is one.
Yes! Punish the betrayers!
Our instincts align.
The Baron must die.
Abomination!
You shall aid our cause, dragon.
Bring the dragon down.
So your treachery ends.
We have no mercy.
You are condemned.
We will claim you.
Our spear shall find you.
We see their guilt.
Retribution approaches.
Accept no contrition.
Pluck them from their reverie.
Your death has been ordained.
You will never suffer enough!
We shall pierce their treasonous hearts.
Know your folly.
You have earned your fate.
Bleed, betrayer!
Be judged.
They disgust us.
None can evade us.
It is time.
Traitors!
The oath has been taken.
Vengeance is at hand.
The pact is made.
Our retribution shall be swift.
Our fates are intertwined.
Blood seals our pact.
We are one now.
We have heard your plea.
Do not forsake us, ashedid.
We will not be impeded.
We will not be at the mercy of those who hide behind magic.
Foul sorcery shall not deter us.
In the end, it was nothis bladethat stole our lives.
As once it symbolized hope, so now shall it incite despair!
Once,hewas a noble king, until grief overcame his reason.
As they weaken, so shall we grow stronger.
Our need goes deeper than blood.
Feed our cause.
So shall others feel the bite of steel.
Its edge is keen as the spear's tip.
This sharpens our focus.
Nothing can protect them from our retribution.
We will pierce their souls.
Our spears heed no armor.
Feel our hate.
Thus is our vengeance exacted.
Your pain is no more than a trifle to us.
Now!
No respite!
Crawl!
You too shall have a blade in your back, snake.
No such snake shall go unpunished.
Serpent, we sense your disgrace.
Graves, you have only to speak our name.
We taste your anger, Graves.
Give in to your hate, Graves.
You toy with powers you do not comprehend, Deathsinger.
Only a fool would embrace death, Karthus.
Death is not solely your purview, Karthus.
Your duplicity ends here, Lissandra.
We see the course of your deception, Ice Witch.
We see through you, Ice Witch.
You are a vile betrayer, Cardmaster!
Twisted Fate, your hour approaches.
There is no loss greater than betrayal, Varus.
You have pledged yourself to a false agent, Varus.
Your retribution lacks aim, Varus.
Nothing shall distract—hey- hey-hey!!
We act as one- two- three-cease this!
There will be no escape...I said no escape!
Our aim does not falter.
We never miss.
Our spears are precise.
We are not finished with you!
Return our spear!
You will be taken!
The dead feel not the cold.
The blood of kith and kin stains their hands.
Turncoats, oath breakers and betrayers... we hate them all.
There can be no justice. Only revenge.
Promises must be kept.
Trust... is a weapon.
We trusted.
We are called elsewhere.
We go where we are needed.
All things have consequence.
What is started will be finished.
We can be anywhere.
We... I—must remember.
Kalista... yes, that was our name.
Know our pain, know our truth.
The wounds of betrayal never heal.
We began as one.
Nothing shall turn us from our path.
One thought drives us.
We are vengeance.
Our hatred burns cold.
We never rest.
We are set in motion.
Our task is unending.
Back to back, we stood.
Why?
We remain true to our purpose.
Nothing is more heinous than treachery.
Weep!
Suffer!
Fall!
They shall not have you!
Our bond preserves you!
It is not yet your time!
Claim your due.
To our side.
Hurt them.
It is your turn.
Know that we shall return.
We must attend to other matters.
Let's see how many spears you can endure!
You could never bear our burden!
Soft are the targets of our spears today!
We are unbound!
Bind us!
The pact remains unfulfilled!
We are always aware.
We trust nothing to chance.
We watch.
Be our eyes!
Seek!
Go!
Find them!
Death to all betrayers.
