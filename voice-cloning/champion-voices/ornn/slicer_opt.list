Ornn_Ban.wav|ornn|en|Back to the forge.
Ornn_Original_AttackAatrox.wav|ornn|en|I don't like the look of that thing.
Ornn_Original_AttackAnivia.wav|ornn|en|We never talk. Might as well fight!
Ornn_Original_AttackGaren.wav|ornn|en|Your sword has no counterbalance!
Ornn_Original_AttackGragas.wav|ornn|en|Give me the ale and no one gets hurt.
Ornn_Original_AttackHeimerdinger.wav|ornn|en|Stop building!
Ornn_Original_AttackPoppy.wav|ornn|en|My hammer is better.
Ornn_Original_AttackTeemo.wav|ornn|en|I do not like you.
Ornn_Original_AttackVolibear.wav|ornn|en|This is for my followers!
Ornn_Original_Attack_0.wav|ornn|en|You like that? I do!
Ornn_Original_Attack_1.wav|ornn|en|Even my beard is angry!
Ornn_Original_Attack_10.wav|ornn|en|Ahhh, hitting relieves stress.
Ornn_Original_Attack_11.wav|ornn|en|An iron will must be forged!
Ornn_Original_Attack_13.wav|ornn|en|This will ring nicely!
Ornn_Original_Attack_14.wav|ornn|en|You are a nail.
Ornn_Original_Attack_15.wav|ornn|en|The workisthe reward!
Ornn_Original_Attack_16.wav|ornn|en|I will hit you until minerals fall out!
Ornn_Original_Attack_17.wav|ornn|en|Nose, meet grindstone!
Ornn_Original_Attack_18.wav|ornn|en|Nose! Meet grindstone!
Ornn_Original_Attack_2.wav|ornn|en|This is called building character!
Ornn_Original_Attack_20.wav|ornn|en|I wasworking!
Ornn_Original_Attack_21.wav|ornn|en|Good,yes!
Ornn_Original_Attack_22.wav|ornn|en|Fighting is my first language.
Ornn_Original_Attack_3.wav|ornn|en|I have a hard head.
Ornn_Original_Attack_4.wav|ornn|en|Enough!
Ornn_Original_Attack_5.wav|ornn|en|Hold still!
Ornn_Original_Attack_6.wav|ornn|en|That's a whompin'!
Ornn_Original_Attack_7.wav|ornn|en|Good!Yes!
Ornn_Original_Attack_8.wav|ornn|en|Hammer never fails.
Ornn_Original_Attack_9.wav|ornn|en|Now this I like!
Ornn_Original_Death_0.wav|ornn|en|I broke my beard...
Ornn_Original_Death_1.wav|ornn|en|Well done...
Ornn_Original_JokeResponse_0.wav|ornn|en|Buy a joke book. And a clown.
Ornn_Original_JokeResponse_1.wav|ornn|en|I now like you less. I did not think that was possible.
Ornn_Original_JokeResponse_2.wav|ornn|en|No.
Ornn_Original_JokeResponse_3.wav|ornn|en|Stop it.
Ornn_Original_KillPenta.wav|ornn|en|Problems solved.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_0.wav|ornn|en|Build it again. Correctly.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_1.wav|ornn|en|I've seen sturdier sandcastles.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_10.wav|ornn|en|Bad workmanship.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_11.wav|ornn|en|Shattered and melted.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_12.wav|ornn|en|Mortal craftsmanship,please.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_13.wav|ornn|en|Heheh, broke that real good.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_14.wav|ornn|en|Whoops. Found a flaw.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_2.wav|ornn|en|Too much sorcery, not enough elbow grease.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_3.wav|ornn|en|It's always the magic parts that break.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_4.wav|ornn|en|Honestly, though, I was just leaning on it.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_5.wav|ornn|en|Heh, not one of mine.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_6.wav|ornn|en|Barely touched it.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_7.wav|ornn|en|Easy build, easy break.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_8.wav|ornn|en|A strong sneeze would've had the same effect.
Ornn_Original_KillTurret_9.wav|ornn|en|Demolished! Easy.
Ornn_Original_KillWard_0.wav|ornn|en|Spy on that.
Ornn_Original_KillWard_1.wav|ornn|en|There, fixed that for you.
Ornn_Original_KillWard_3.wav|ornn|en|Was like that when I found it.
Ornn_Original_KillWard_4.wav|ornn|en|Not on my watch.
Ornn_Original_KillWard_5.wav|ornn|en|Early warning is key.
Ornn_Original_KillWard_6.wav|ornn|en|Heheh! Broke it real good.
Ornn_Original_Kill_0.wav|ornn|en|Ahhh.
Ornn_Original_Kill_1.wav|ornn|en|Job complete.
Ornn_Original_Kill_10.wav|ornn|en|Fixed!
Ornn_Original_Kill_11.wav|ornn|en|Back to work.
Ornn_Original_Kill_12.wav|ornn|en|That fixed everything.
Ornn_Original_Kill_2.wav|ornn|en|Well, that happened.
Ornn_Original_Kill_3.wav|ornn|en|Mhm. Yup. Dead.
Ornn_Original_Kill_4.wav|ornn|en|That's done.
Ornn_Original_Kill_5.wav|ornn|en|Character built.
Ornn_Original_Kill_6.wav|ornn|en|It has not been a pleasure.
Ornn_Original_Kill_7.wav|ornn|en|Nailed it.
Ornn_Original_Kill_8.wav|ornn|en|Job done! Time to go home.
Ornn_Original_Kill_9.wav|ornn|en|That was more fun than I expected.
Ornn_Original_MoveBase_0.wav|ornn|en|Could do without the statues.
Ornn_Original_MoveBase_1.wav|ornn|en|Decent stonework.
Ornn_Original_MoveBase_2.wav|ornn|en|Hmm...Noxiangranite. Respectable choice.
Ornn_Original_MoveBase_3.wav|ornn|en|The architecture here is not wholly terrible.
Ornn_Original_MoveBase_4.wav|ornn|en|Walls are fine.
Ornn_Original_MoveBase_5.wav|ornn|en|Huh, loose cobblestone. Will fix later.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirstEnemyVolibear_0.wav|ornn|en|I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirstEnemyVolibear_1.wav|ornn|en|Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!
Ornn_Original_MoveFirstEnemyVolibear_2.wav|ornn|en|Singed fur... jealous blood... my brother is near!
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|ornn|en|I have fur. It is soft. Do not hug me.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|ornn|en|If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|ornn|en|The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... mmm.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|ornn|en|I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... 'Hammer.'
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|ornn|en|TheFreljordis a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home, sweet home.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|ornn|en|Name's Ornn. No further pleasantries needed.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|ornn|en|I will go over there. It looks quiet. It will be nice.
Ornn_Original_MoveFirst_7.wav|ornn|en|I am going this way. Do not follow me. Please.
Ornn_Original_MoveRiver_0.wav|ornn|en|I did not want to cool off, but this feels nice.
Ornn_Original_MoveRiver_1.wav|ornn|en|Volibear made the first river. You do not want to know how.
Ornn_Original_MoveRiver_2.wav|ornn|en|Hmm, this river needs a dam.
Ornn_Original_Move_0.wav|ornn|en|It is childish to favor one tool over another! But Hammer is my favorite.
Ornn_Original_Move_1.wav|ornn|en|Bah, look at all these lazy trees.
Ornn_Original_Move_10.wav|ornn|en|Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure.
Ornn_Original_Move_11.wav|ornn|en|This world has potential. Needs hammering.
Ornn_Original_Move_12.wav|ornn|en|I do not need company; only a wall, to keep out company.
Ornn_Original_Move_13.wav|ornn|en|Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods.
Ornn_Original_Move_14.wav|ornn|en|I had followers once. They tried.
Ornn_Original_Move_15.wav|ornn|en|A day away from my forge is a day wasted.
Ornn_Original_Move_16.wav|ornn|en|The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good.
Ornn_Original_Move_17.wav|ornn|en|My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel.
Ornn_Original_Move_18.wav|ornn|en|Luck is failure that failed.
Ornn_Original_Move_19.wav|ornn|en|All I need is myself, and... Hammer.
Ornn_Original_Move_2.wav|ornn|en|Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer...
Ornn_Original_Move_20.wav|ornn|en|I enjoy being alone. Fewer unintended casualties.
Ornn_Original_Move_21.wav|ornn|en|I will make an axe that is also a sword... and possibly a spoon.
Ornn_Original_Move_3.wav|ornn|en|My forge is my home.
Ornn_Original_Move_34.wav|ornn|en|Solitude always meets my expectations.
Ornn_Original_Move_4.wav|ornn|en|The last time I ate a plant was never.
Ornn_Original_Move_5.wav|ornn|en|The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins...
Ornn_Original_Move_6.wav|ornn|en|'Ornn builds things, go see Ornn.' Nobody ever says thank you.
Ornn_Original_Move_7.wav|ornn|en|Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again.
Ornn_Original_Move_8.wav|ornn|en|Everything is better when it is molten; lead, iron, chocolate cake.
Ornn_Original_Move_9.wav|ornn|en|Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_0.wav|ornn|en|Do not waste that.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_1.wav|ornn|en|Ornn tested, Ornn approved.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_10.wav|ornn|en|A good axe will fell a tree. A great axe will fell an army.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_11.wav|ornn|en|The weapons I forge do not have names. They have ambitions.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_12.wav|ornn|en|No exchanges.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_13.wav|ornn|en|That is for wielding,notfor entertaining.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_14.wav|ornn|en|You may be worthy of that. Do not prove me wrong.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_15.wav|ornn|en|I didn't make that. You didn't buy it.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_16.wav|ornn|en|Huh. You are not entirely an arse.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_17.wav|ornn|en|You remind me of a young me, who was less impressive.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_18.wav|ornn|en|Working with you is almost like working alone. Almost.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_19.wav|ornn|en|Something you should know about me...
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_2.wav|ornn|en|I was looking at that one too.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_20.wav|ornn|en|Your job is not dying.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_3.wav|ornn|en|This does not mean we are friends.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_4.wav|ornn|en|Do not hang that on a wall.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_5.wav|ornn|en|If you want a weapon, here's a weapon. If you want conversation... here's a weapon.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_6.wav|ornn|en|That is what good looks like.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_7.wav|ornn|en|That's a weapon... you know, for fighting.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_8.wav|ornn|en|I trust you know how to use that.
Ornn_Original_P_allypurchasesitem_9.wav|ornn|en|You will not be disappointed.
Ornn_Original_P_finishforging_0.wav|ornn|en|Hmm.
Ornn_Original_P_finishforging_2.wav|ornn|en|Good... yes.
Ornn_Original_P_finishforging_4.wav|ornn|en|I taughtDoraneverything he knows.
Ornn_Original_P_finishforging_5.wav|ornn|en|Hmm.
Ornn_Original_P_finishforging_7.wav|ornn|en|Hmm...
Ornn_Original_P_finishforging_8.wav|ornn|en|Ahh.
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_0.wav|ornn|en|Don't start without me!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_1.wav|ornn|en|Hot stuff!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_10.wav|ornn|en|My horns are on the way!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_2.wav|ornn|en|Hooold!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_3.wav|ornn|en|I'm on my way. Stop asking.
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_4.wav|ornn|en|You each owe me a beer!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_5.wav|ornn|en|You requested my aid!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_6.wav|ornn|en|Hooooold!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_7.wav|ornn|en|Incoming!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_8.wav|ornn|en|Hold!
Ornn_Original_PingOnMyWay_9.wav|ornn|en|Hold!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_0.wav|ornn|en|Horns first!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_1.wav|ornn|en|Everyone get behind me!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_2.wav|ornn|en|This will be fun!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_3.wav|ornn|en|Ready for this?!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_4.wav|ornn|en|Fire up the forge!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_5.wav|ornn|en|Turn up the heat!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_6.wav|ornn|en|Fine! I will intervene!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_7.wav|ornn|en|We fight now!
Ornn_Original_PingTarget_8.wav|ornn|en|Into the fray!
Ornn_Original_RecallCancel_0.wav|ornn|en|Hmph. Never mind.
Ornn_Original_RecallCancel_1.wav|ornn|en|Changed my mind.
Ornn_Original_Respawn_0.wav|ornn|en|I didn't die. My forge missed me.
Ornn_Original_Respawn_1.wav|ornn|en|Rekindled the old furnace.
Ornn_Original_Respawn_2.wav|ornn|en|Still no water in the fountain.
Ornn_Original_Respawn_3.wav|ornn|en|I'm used to this level of disappointment.
Ornn_Original_Respawn_4.wav|ornn|en|'We're ready, Ornn, we'll be right behind you'...
Ornn_Original_Respawn_5.wav|ornn|en|Good job, everyone.
Ornn_Original_Respawn_6.wav|ornn|en|Just leave everything to me, as usual.
Ornn_Original_TauntResponse_0.wav|ornn|en|I do not care at all.
Ornn_Original_TauntResponse_1.wav|ornn|en|I do not care at all.
Ornn_Original_TauntResponse_3.wav|ornn|en|This is a waste of my time.
Ornn_Original_Taunt_1.wav|ornn|en|I don't know what you do and I don't care.
Ornn_Original_Taunt_2.wav|ornn|en|Your base is that way! Go cower in it.
Ornn_Original_Taunt_3.wav|ornn|en|Whatever you want, the answer is 'go away.'
Ornn_Original_Teleport_0.wav|ornn|en|Here we go.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_1.wav|ornn|en|Efficient travel method. I approve.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_10.wav|ornn|en|Hmm, this is fast, but it can't be good for you.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_2.wav|ornn|en|I swear, if Volibear is there...
Ornn_Original_Teleport_3.wav|ornn|en|I prefer walking... but, fine.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_4.wav|ornn|en|Time to show them the horns.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_5.wav|ornn|en|A fight's where I want to be.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_6.wav|ornn|en|I love a surprise.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_7.wav|ornn|en|I'll just drop by.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_8.wav|ornn|en|They won't be ready for me.
Ornn_Original_Teleport_9.wav|ornn|en|A good workman is needed.
Ornn_Original_UseItemPotion_0.wav|ornn|en|That hit the spot.
Ornn_Original_UseItemPotion_1.wav|ornn|en|Whatever this drink is made of, it is working.
Ornn_Original_UseItemPotion_2.wav|ornn|en|Fuel for the old hearth-fire.
Ornn_Original_UseItemPotion_3.wav|ornn|en|Hmm, cherry flavored. Not bad.
Ornn_Original_UseItemPotion_4.wav|ornn|en|Heyyy, this is pretty good stuff.
Ornn_Original_UseItemWard_0.wav|ornn|en|I don't know how to feel about this thing, but okay.
Ornn_Original_UseItemWard_1.wav|ornn|en|Is it on?
Ornn_Original_UseItemWard_2.wav|ornn|en|Hmm, that all it does? Okay.
Ornn_Original_UseItemWard_3.wav|ornn|en|You stay here.
Ornn_Original_UseItemWard_4.wav|ornn|en|I do not like surprises.
Ornn_Select.wav|ornn|en|Fine, we go.
