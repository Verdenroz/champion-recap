wavs/audio_0004.wav|Beast of ancient legend, face me!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|I have slain greater dragons than you.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Give my regards to the viper worms.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Finally, a true monster of the old world.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I've waited a long time to fight a myth like you.

wavs/audio_0014.wav|Yes! Claim your joy!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|My waters cut deep!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Find your form, water!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Such happiness!

wavs/audio_0022.wav|A worthy adversary!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|My bliss is battle.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Water, to me!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Joy in all things!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|The river swells!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Demon, obey me!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|And how strong areyou?
wavs/audio_0029.wav|They will write songs about this!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Remember… my name…
wavs/audio_0031.wav|The time is now!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Joy has found you!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Advance!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Face me!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Prepare for death!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Here I am!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Close in!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Is this a test, gods? I hope you don't mind losing your Aspect.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Fallen lords of light, now flesh and rage, will you face me?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You are nothing, demon! I've crushedhundredsof your kind.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Lord of Fear, I know what youreallyare and I know how to kill you.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|How many times must I embarrass you, Malcolm Graves?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Test me, Illaoi. I know I will prevail.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|To think, the brave Kalista ofCamavor, reduced to this…
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Your ancestors and mine once shared a homeland, Darha.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Twin faces of death, I test my mettle against the end itself!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I know your name, Sahn-Uzal. You are weak to fear death.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Atreus, is it? Few are worthy to hold power such as ours.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You left Viego on our doorstep, Sentinel. Not very neighborly.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|We are not alike, Jericho Swain. I know the price I paid.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Tobias Felix. You're a cheat and a bad friend, and I don't like you.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Viego, we didn't fall to Camavor when you lived and I won't fall now!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|You have begun to fade, Thousand-Pierced Bear, but I will give you one last battle.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Prepare yourself, joy will not falter.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|I am Nilah of the Seventh Layer. Let us begin.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|True happiness lies in the heart of battle! Let us claim it.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Give me five, demon— OWW! What are you doing!? That was way too hard!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You sound nervous. Are you compensating? Do you need a moment?
wavs/audio_0059.wav|HA!First of nothing! Tell theother eightwhere to find me.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Conquer the foe before you, no matter how great.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Now you know what you're up against.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|That was fast. Should I have held back?
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Call me when you need me, Malcolm Graves, but I tire of this.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Strange, I feel a third presence. Something far older.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|I am the living joy! Remember my name:Nilah!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|The greatest foes are mine alone. Let no one forget.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Hmm… Malcolm Graves deserved better.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Old Camavor's evil ends where it began… with a broken heart.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|May you find joy in the world beyond.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Another chapter in the epic of Nilah!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|An enemy of skill and worth—I thank you.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I am a power far beyond you, I'm afraid.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|When you meet the demon, warn him of my strength.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I slay foes the size of mountains! You were… fine, I guess.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The river of fate drowns the unworthy.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I am unbound from the world, mighty and joyous. May evil tremble before me.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|In death,Ashlesh, my spirit is yours. But in life, your strength and joy belong to me.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Ashlesh, Lord of Joy, for stealing my name and my fate, I claim your power.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Bilgewateris nice. There's always something big to kill.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Raging demigods, dragons, the age of the world… *scoffs* Not enough. Who's next?
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Joy is not an easy power to master. It infects you, becomes you.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I exist in but a single moment: eternal, unbreaking bliss.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|My past is gone, traded for the strength to do good.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Seven hands reach for seven locks, yearning to break free.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I will face the great villains of myth, and live forever in song.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Evil hides in every corner of the world, but I always find it.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|They can't remember the woman I was, but will know the hero I am.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|The Lord of Joy rages in his prison, his power taken… by me.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I prefer my enemies several stories tall… keeps things fair.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Be water, my friend
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Bring me more foes to defeat.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I will topple giants.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|There is great power behind this smile… Be wary.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Joy wasmychoice. I would choose it again.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Rage in your prison, demon! I am in control.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|No god nor devil can stop me!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|All I feel is joy! It is… difficult.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I need only three weapons: water, muscle, mind.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|May these battles ink the pages of history.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|No adversary is too powerful for me.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Cast away fear and spit in the eye of evil.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Triumph and exaltation.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|It isthrillingto face the beasts of old!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|For this strength, I gaveeverything.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|May we lose ourselves to joy.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Master one evil, then destroy the rest.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|The bigger they are, the better the fight.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|River of fate, guide me to greatness.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|My epic will be long and joyous.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Water binds us, as it binds the demon.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Bliss in life, and bliss for ever after.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Turn darkness against itself.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Embrace joy!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Joy protect you!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Gentle waters.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Cover them!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|The river carries you!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Feel bliss!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Delightful.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Joyous!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Flow!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|With speed!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Again!

wavs/audio_0125.wav|Water, strike!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Felicity!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Jubilation!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Cast down he fell, reaching upward with his seven hands.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Ashlesh turned to gaze upon the stars, and his hungers only grew.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|He rests now, trapped in the Seventh Layer deep beneath the waters.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Ha! My joy endures!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|My legend remains unwritten.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The epic of Nilah does not end here.

wavs/audio_0139.wav|No foe can match me!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Dance upon the lake!
