wavs/audio_0001.wav|I won't hold my breath.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Remember who helped you in your hour of need.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You're welcome.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I'm sure my parents would be proud.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|You owe me.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Loyalty is rewarded.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Someday I will call upon you to do something for me.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Nothing's free. All I ask is your loyalty.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Let the world know of the generosity of Renata Glasc.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Well done, pet.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Watch the suit!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|High-class chemtech.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I said:jump!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Waste of my time.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Don't hold your breath!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|We're downsizing.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I'm busy.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Choke!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Get a job!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Worthless wretch!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Die for me.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Breathe deep!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Filth!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Your value's dropped!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Money talks.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Finally... I can see them again...
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I'll bill you later!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Now, this is synergy.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Disrupting the market!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Two alchemists were murdered over thirty years ago, Camille. Do you remember them?
wavs/audio_0031.wav|How are your parents, Ekko? If only you'd let me help them.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Where were you when we needed you most, Janna?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Entertaining as you are, Jinx, you're wasting both your time and your talent.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I will choke your city and laugh as they suffocate, Piltovan!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|I bankrolled your pistols' makers, Samira. Those guns are mine by right.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Sing your little songs of unity while you can, traitor.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|We could have done great work together, Singed. Pity.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Piltover will fall to me, Swain, not to Noxus.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Doesn't matter how loud you bark or how hard you bite, Vi. A lap dog's a lap dog.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|You forget whose money made you what you are, Viktor.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Zeri... Perhaps I might have been more like you if my parents had survived: poor and weak.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Let's not waste my time, hmm?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|I prefer my takeovers to be hostile. Indulge me.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Ah, good. I can write this off as a business expense.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Bold of you to stand against me.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|If you're not working for me, you're working against me.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Do you know who I am? If you don't, you will.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|You'll come around to my side with the right incentive.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|We don't have to be enemies. Let me change your mind.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I mean, it's one banana, Michael, what could it cost? Ten dollars?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Go away, my dear. Pray for a sense of humor.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|The work is never over, and I love my work!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Your hextech won't save you.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Give my parents my love, won't you?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|You were regrettably expendable, my dear.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I have no regrets, but I bet somebody does.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Ah, the price of progress.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You don't deserve nice things.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Never cross Renata Glasc!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|My profit, your loss.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|This is why all my products are five-stars.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Poor thing.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|It's just business.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Let's see hextech do that!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Oh, I love it... Hahahahahahaha!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Ah, my favorite part of the job: product testing.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Every fashionable Piltovan owns at least one of my products. So trusting, so naive.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Work for me or work against me, it doesn't matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Alright, I've got companies to buy and a city to crush, so let's make this quick.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. Allow me to demonstrate.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I remember starving in the sump, a pathetic little nothing of a girl. Look at me now!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|It's expensive to be poor. But when you're rich, they just give you things.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Piltover coos over perfumes... while Zaun struggles to breathe.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Hard work is its own reward. *Laughs* No, it's the money!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I gave out breathers in exchange for Zaun's loyalty. Hah, those dividends are priceless!
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I provide people with two options: do what I want, or do what I want but with more steps.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|When my parents handed out their cures, they asked for nothing, so we had nothing. Kind, but foolish.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Money can't buy happiness? Only someonebornrich would agree with that.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|I love my city. But if I had to burn down Zaun to smoke out Piltover, well...
wavs/audio_0080.wav|My decanter is just one more pawn to push.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Progress comes at a price others aren't willing to pay.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Ambition isn't greed.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Piltover will suffer for its crimes against me.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Wealth writes the laws that governments enforce.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Zaun deserves more.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Who said chemtech can't be beautiful?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|There's a reason I call the shots.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Empires aren't built on 'enough.'
wavs/audio_0089.wav|No one even thought to invest in chemtech before I did.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Power can be bought, much like loyalty.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Piltover doesn't deserve the Sun Gate.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|All my parents left me was my name. Now, it's worth millions.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|She who controls the Sun Gate controls the world!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|The other chem-barons fear my reach, as they should.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Throw scraps to the hungry, and they thank you for the feast.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Years of investing in Zaun has paid off handsomely.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I used to have rivals, now I have business partners.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Ugh, the air is so much thinner up here.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I don't forgive debts, and I never forget them.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Most chem-barons are lackeys who failed upward.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Zaun is not beneath Piltover, no matter how it may appear.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I don't need to get my hands dirty. Oh, but I do enjoy it.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Competition is for the weak. I dominate.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Move, now!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|I adore this arm!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Out of my way!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Step aside, worm!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Time to make some new business partners.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Progress.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Ready to take control.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Kill them and suffer!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|You work for me now!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|My latest product!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Alright, let's go make my accountant cry!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Is that a stain? Ugh, now I need a whole new suit!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Ugh, I need a breather.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I expect to see progress when I get back.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The boss shouldn't have to be in the factory for the work to get done.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Mistakes were made.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|This decanter had better be indestructible, or somebody is getting fired!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|No! I willnotdie before Piltover falls!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Time to collect what I'm owed.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Blood is a big expense. Luckily, I'm rich.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I'll make them forget they ever saw me stumble.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|'I'll make you kill your loved ones' is a more effective threat than any gun.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Why must you be so constantly irksome?
wavs/audio_0127.wav|For the needy.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|They ought to thank me.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|A worthy investment.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|A charitable donation.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|I'm a giver.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Prove your worth!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Get the job done!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Make them pay!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|You know what to do.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|That's an order!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Don't make me ask again.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Sic 'em.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|It's 'Miss Glasc'... if you value your life.
