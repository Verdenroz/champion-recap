The weak fear the shadows.
These things always prove to be a challenge.
How tedious.
Ughh... This may take a while.
I will enjoy this, Darius.
Revenge...
Death is inevitable.
Pain fades...
Run, from the shadows.
You dance on the shadow's edge.
I am everywhere.
Your mistake!
Silence, then pain.
No way out.
Fleeing won't save you!
Feel this!
This will be quick!
The light will not save you.
I'm coming for you!
Shadow is not your friend.
I'm here!
Shadows touch all!
I buy, they die. Simple.
Oh yes, this is the right choice.
Are you afraid now? You should be.
Sight, a pitiful crutch for the weak.
Oh, please.
Prying eye shall perish, too.
No escape...
Hush...
I am everywhere...
Surprise!
Goodbye!
So easy.
That never gets old.
I'll let you in on a secret, you will not live much longer.
The light's your best chance, but you're still going to die.
There are twelve ways to kill you. Sorry, thirteen. It's still thirteen.
You and Rhaast, the failed blades.
The more they send, the more they will bury.
Your stance was weak, your tactics elementary and your execution sluggish.
Shadows and the blade proved too much.
The fallen only make me stronger.
Strength alone is not enough.
And that is why I am the one.
They too will call me master.
Four. Who's next?
That may do, for some.
Perfection is near...
Zed says hello... and goodbye.
It did not have to end this way, Zed.
They should stay down.
Wrong place, wrong time.
You will not be remembered.
Balance? Balance favors the victorious.
So brave, so foolish, so dead.
Be thankful it's over.
Fools die and are forgotten.
Death finds all, and so quickly.
Retreat was a better option.
You were not chosen... to live.
There was a time to run, but you missed it.
True believers live forever, they will die forgotten.
The darkin is gone. Our enemies are next.
Kill the body. Build the body. Free the body.
I wield the whisper of darkness.
Every corpse a lesson, every threat a target.
The blade of millenia exercises my will.
This is as it was meant to be.
I bested the darkin, now the plan continues.
I was forged by the uncaring providence of war.
Zed now walks in my shadow.
The reaping begins with purpose.
Light offers no sanctuary.
Bathing my enemies in shadow, I leave the light to the opressed.
With this blade, I am invincible!
Kill the mind. Build the mind. Free the mind.
My path cuts through the bodies of the unwilling.
My greatness has been realized.
Enough for now. I will return stronger.
Not every battle is a fight.
That only served to sharpen my focus, and my blade.
That was not the plan.
A lucky stab in the dark.
They will never see us coming.
Together, Zed, we are unstoppable!
Your stance is that of a two-legged goat.
This is the part where you run.
I live in shadow. Others need light.
My enemies will have no place to hide.
This trinket may prove useful here.
He's with you, I assume?
Such a waste of time.
Sure. Why not?
This will only dull the blade.
Well... we're here.
The bigger they are...
This brings me no pleasure, Shen.
Teacher and student, yes?
This is your master? Zed?
Set me free!
Found you!
From the shadow comes the slaughter.
Again!
Feed me more lives!
Kill them all!
Shadows cut deep as fear!
They're next.
Another target!
Time to reap.
Again!
You have my undivided attention!
Never underestimate hatred.
Fear the darkened blade!
Found you!
Again!
The blade bends to you!
Cowering in the light... how foolish!
The shadows find everyone.
Every slaughter has humble beginnings.
They are worthy?
Drive me into their flesh!
Good choice. Pairs nicely with wrath and fury.
Well, you know what you want...
Aren't I enough?
You're making me jealous.
This will very much upset the balance.
Not my first choice, but okay.
A match made in shadow.
These trinkets only annoy me.
Sight... A pitiful crutch for the weak.
Darkness falls.
Yes...!
Yes...
No escape...
Fear this!
Here we go!
Ripped out!
Too late.
That's one to remember!
Hush...
This is power!
You let me in... So foolish!
I find your will to live amusing...
I'm holding a sentient weapon of doom, denied blood for eons! You think I'm scared of you?
"I can see twelve ways to kill you. Ah! Correction: thirteen. It's thirteen.
A craftsman never blames his tools.
I smell death... Nope, it's you. You smell... bad.
Your skills have not improved, Aatrox.
Sorry, brother. You were in my way.
Merely the first to die. There will be more.
That was for Zed.
You never forget your first kill... Nope, that's not right. I've already forgotten it.
Ooohhh! That felt good.
Noxian strength is a lie.
No mercy! Right, Noxian?
You wanted mercy? Not from me!
Where are the worthy?
Stand back! Kayn doesn't know how deadly this thing gets!
That's four by my count.
Shen. Consider this a debt paid to a friend.
Demon-pants had it coming.
You taught me too well, master.
Live by the shadow, die by the shadow...
It should not have come to this, Zed...
Zed's final lesson? Don't be him.
Pulp Fiction
The shadows are my realm... and your grave.
Fear is your shadow! You are cloaked in it.
Those seeking balance will find death.
Triumph is built on a foundation of death.
That was your destiny... to die.
Every kill fuels my fury.
Death delivered with precision is true power.
What was written in shadow, now in flesh.
Why murder one, when you can slaughter many?
Facing me was a mistake.
Even Zed would be impressed.
This is but a taste of my wrath.
Cowards hide, but never escape.
Death finds fools quickly.
Just like that, and the world will be yours to destroy.
Balance is weakness.
The strong fall so quickly to my blade.
Shadows are a shallow grave.
My potential has been realized!
The only way to kill...
Those who seek balance find only death.
The reaping has begun!
With each kill, the shadows grow deeper.
Tenacity versus fury... Fury always wins.
These are the strong? Pathetic.
Yes! Slaughter.
Worthless foes mock my presence.
There is fear in your grip and doubt in your heart.
Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed.
The child is gone. The killer will remain...
Rage inside me will not be contained!
I will survive eternity. They will die today.
The undoing draws near.
The true assassin kills one to save many.
Cast off the yoke of Zed's order.
The blood of the fallen will annoint me the new master.
Stain this fetid swamp with their blood.
Oh, how I miss the smell of blood in the water.
Wait by the river long enough and the enemy dead will float by.
Oh, yeah... Let's turn this river red.
Neither time nor violence will end me.
This is the part I like best: the anticipation. No, it's the killing.
I am the weapon. You are a tool.
The rage is in your hands. Let it loose!
Zed's order shackles you. I offer freedom!
Underestimate me at your peril.
I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy.
What does Rhaast mean anyway?
The shadows reveal weakness.
I have chosen you. You will serve me.
Ionians... Are they all as confident as you?
I am no toy, Kayn.
Kill the body.
Kill the mind.
Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?
I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows.
I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!
I let you go and you will die.
The focused blade cuts deepest.
I have mastered every weapon of war. No prattling tool will prove an exception.
Such an obsequious pupil. I will be your new master.
You are not worthy of the power you hold.
I see your nightmares. Do they trouble you?
Their screams thrill me.
Target the strong. I am a weapon, not some accessory.
What will be the final lesson?
Whom should I obey? Master Zed, or the farm implement with delusions of grandeur?
Their screams will echo in this place.
There is much darkness around you... in you.
The weak run. Stay and fight!
The fight will continue.
But there's still so much to kill!
Retreat?!
This is gonna be weird, Aatrox!
Nothing personal, brother!
He just won't die!
So little! So annoying! Sohardto kill!
Kayn failed, as will you, Zed!
Shadows aren't enough, Zed!
I own the dark now, Zed!
There you are!
Take the pain!
Killing is so liberating!
Wrath!
Feel my fury!
Cleave them to pieces!
I want to show you something...!
Reap what's too slow!
Feel this!
Wrath is mine!
Take a look at this!
Slash 'em up!
Have a slice!
Oh yeahhhhh!
Die!
No one escapes!
Cut 'em down!
Come here!
What can I say? I like destroying things!
I prefer the sound of flesh being torn, but oh well...
I'd prefer to gouge out all their eyes, but this will have to do.
Yeeesss...
Yeeeeesss...
Yeeeesss...
I do like this trick!
Yeeesss...
Walk it off...
Such a gracious host!
I'm outta here!
That'll kill ya!
And... you're dead.
Key to staying alive? Don't be you.
You have two options: one, die quietly. Two, die loudly... Okay, one option really.
Sorry, brother. You were in my way.
And then there were four... I think.
Oh, please. You would have done the same.
I'm just getting started.
Try and stop me!
I am unstoppable!
Yes! Yes! Yesss!
Bringer of death! Taker of lives! Rhaast, if you're in a hurry.
Yes! Bow before greatness!
All have fallen before me! I am the undoing!
So close to perfection! Who's next?
Don't stop now! I'm so close!
Stand back! It's only going to get messier...
No more demon-pants.
The Order of the Shadow is dead, just like you and Kayn.
Dead, just like Kayn.
All your shadows, steel, and bluster... and now look at you.
You hear that? Neither do I. Because everyone is dead!
No one mourns you!
Your failure mocks this world.
That was some good murdering!
I pity the rest of your kind!
Even your stain won't last a day!
Not worthy.
Is there no one left to kill? You're welcome...
Pitiful. They send only fools!
Kneel before Rhaast!
That was all me!
You're not special, just one of many!
That weapon was so... confining!
Their blood will decorate the ground, and the walls! Everything, really...
Which to wreak first? Carnage, havoc, or mayhem? I just can't decide...
I survived eternity. They will die today — and the next —andthe next!
I am the undoing!
Poor Kayn! Guess I was a bad influence after all...
Bring on the weak, and the strong! All will die!
The shadows have a new master!
How I missed this!
Kayn weeps in the abyss between oblivions... Idiot.
Shadows? Perhaps. Order? Not so much.
Let's go make some corpses!
I cannot wait to infest them!
Kayn wasted this flesh. Rhaast will not.
My plan: wrath! Simple, messy, delicious...
I already miss killing!
I'd rather be unleashing wrath.
I guess that is better than walking.
Okay! That did not work.
Hm. So that's what dying feels like. Good thing I'm immortal!
Again! This time, they die!
Varus, the three of us— um, five of us— well...together, we will lay waste to this realm!
Yes, Varus! Let us sow chaos!
Do not press me, Aatrox. This is my time!
We're moving to plan B, Aatrox: you die.
I will nevernotkill a Yordle.
This ends badly for you I'm afraid.
I have broken the great Kayn. You thinkyoucan defeat me?!
Now I am pure wrath. Fear me!
Okay... These can be useful.
Done. Resume slaughter!
Helpful to know who I'm murdering.
Death and war. This will be delicious...
We find Aatrox, and it's a party. Of murder. A murder party!
Together, we are unstoppable, Zed!
Your kind go no further!
Your kind go no further!
Yordles... Uggghhh, you sicken me.
I was forged to destroy, and you are in my way.
This will be quick, but still painful.
There are a thousand ways to kill you in this moment. I'm planning the right one...
I will take that pitiful existence you call a life from you.
I am chosen! The Darkin stain lives no more.
The child is gone. The killer remains.
In death, Rhaast now serves me.
I am now one! I am the one!
I am the shadow of death.
I have snuffed out the Darkin, who dares stand against me?
The fullness of my truth stands revealed!
Oh! These legs will take some getting used to.
Now I own the shadows! I will unleash them upon this wretched place!
Oh, the wrath I will unleash!
Destruction! Wrath! Fury! As it was meant to be.
It's all Rhaast now!
Poor Kayn. All those plans for naught.
Goodbye, Kayn! Reaping will commence... now!
Let there be sight.
For those who cannot see in the dark.
Done. Now can we continue the bloodbath?
Will you prove worthy?
