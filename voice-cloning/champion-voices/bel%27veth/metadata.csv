wavs/audio_0002.wav|Nashor, you possess a power Ineed.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|If you refuse to join me, Nashor, thendie.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Your memories will fill the void, Dragon.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Give me your power, Drake.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|You sense what I am, Dragon.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Be remade in the void, Drake.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|You served your purpose, Rift Herald.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|They did not heed your warning, Rift Herald.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|We will be complete.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Expand my consciousness.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I am beyond you.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You struggle for nothing.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|So hungry.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|My victory is certain.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|This could have been easy.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Give me your memories.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.

wavs/audio_0027.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|"""Nowhere to run."
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I will use you well.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Do not disappoint me.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I am not gentle.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I grant you an audience.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|You have my attention.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|My world awaits.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Show me what you are.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Nothing will remain.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Drown in me.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|You crave death.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Feed the void.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|My hungers grow.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|This will be painful.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|All things end.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Bel'Veth grunts angrily.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I will remember this.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|An annoyance.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Let me taste your pain.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Sate my hunger.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Give me everything.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Such sweet emotion.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I crave more.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Only existence can sate your hunger, Cho'Gath.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You disappoint me, Kai'Sa. The Watchers are the true threat.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Kassadin, the void you knew is gone. Your war cannot be won.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Yes, Kha'Zix. You have tasted the world and crave more.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Kog'Maw, so small and yet so much potential.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You cannot fight the Watchers alone, Lissandra.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Witness me, my prophet.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Queen of the Xer'Sai, you of all things resist the change.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Vel'Koz, your Watchers cannot unmake me so easily.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Such intense emotions, ruined king. A meal to match my hungers.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You are new to me, child of the void. Show me your intentions.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Hello my little one. Who's my smoochy poochy baby? You are. You are.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I was born knowing every joke in existence. They fail to move me.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You become greedy, Cho'Gath. Vicious, aren't you?
wavs/audio_0071.wav|You resist me, Kai'Sa, yetIam your salvation.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|As stubborn and brave as your daughter. And now, so am I.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Continue your evolution, Kha'Zix. Devour everything.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Your true self awaits, mouth of the abyss.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Consider an alliance, Lissandra. Consider it carefully.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|You saw the end, Malzahar, now see the beginning.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|All will drown beneath my lavender sea.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|A beast of motherly instinct. The Watchers did not anticipate this.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Every moment of your life now belongs to me, stone weaver.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|The Watchers must die so the void can be reborn.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|They would erase even her memory, ruined king. You can still save her.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|All will be washed away.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|These are the emotions I crave.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Your memories, I want more.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|My metamorphosis continues.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Fuel our evolution.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Such bravery will live on. In me.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Sink beneath my waters.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Everything you were is now part of us.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Let my first steps mark the end of this world.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|You call us nothing, yet we are everything. Every place, every time... we are you.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|All your lives, you have chased your own destruction. At long last, I amhere.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Existence was our cocoon. It has made the void into something more.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Life has infected my kind with the desire to exist. We crave only what was forced upon us.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|For every city that falls, we build ten. For each life we take, a thousand void spawn.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|The void desires an empress. I am the expression of that will.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|You tore us from our formless cradle and cast us into the horror of reality.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|The Watchers did not anticipate my birth. It will be their final mistake.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|When the void first touched existence, both were changed forever.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|This world will not be forgotten. I will replace itâ€”a child devouring its parent.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I will pick this world clean.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|'Empress' is more than a title.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Now, to unmake.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|This is my true self.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|When all is silent, I will remain.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I appreciate such valiant resistance.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The void will drown you all.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|You all should have listened.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Consume, grow, and remake.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Bel'Veth shrieks.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Our victory was decided the moment I was born.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|My Runeterra will be beautiful.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|The light of reality burned, until it did not.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Star Trek: The Next Generation
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Emotions, memories, these are what I crave.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Evolution is never gentle.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I must know what it means to exist.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Humanity is the architect of its own extinction.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Change is necessary.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|My kind will pour across Runeterra and all will fall.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The void cannot go back to what it was.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|We envy the gift of existence.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Undisturbed, the void wanted nothing; now, we simplywant.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|The end awaits.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|A final feast to devour the world.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|All life will be repurposed. The void will live.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|All that will remain is a sea of lavender.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I spread deeper and deeper into the old void.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I am all that is, and all that will ever be.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|There is a vast city growing beneath us. My city.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I crave everything.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I do not feel hatred.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|My mind expands.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Too late.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Prepare.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|No escape.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Wash away.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Drown.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Bel'Veth grunts.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Bel'Veth grunts.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I have grown beyond you all.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|If you will not hear me, you will feed me.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|The time for games has ended.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Nowhere is safe.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|I am done talking.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|You all disappoint me.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Bel'Veth laughs.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|My eyes are everywhere.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Every morsel of this world will fuel our metamorphosis.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|You think yourselves victorious? You are wrong.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|The void demands that I exist; and so, I do.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|"""I have shown restraint, that ends now."
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Hope is the opiate of the masses.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|I emerge from the lavender sea, reborn.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Now you have myfullattention.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Vocalization
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Vocalization
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Vocalization
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Adhere to my will or die.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Your threats mean nothing. I am beyond your comprehension.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|I see all that will be.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Show me the world.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Grant me knowledge.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|We have always watched.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Weakness.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Pathetic.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Beneath me.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|You are nothing.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Begone.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|I will end this.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Bel'Veth shouts.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Bel'Veth shouts.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Bel'Veth shouts.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Bel'Veth shouts.
