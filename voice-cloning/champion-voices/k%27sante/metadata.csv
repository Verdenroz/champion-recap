wavs/audio_0034.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|K'Sante huffs.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Must I do everything?!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Together.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Stand strong.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|K'Sante huffs.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Hurry!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|K'Sante shouts in effort.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Quickly!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|What are you hiding from, Akshan? Fate, or fear?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Others may call you a god. To me, you're just another beast!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Azir! You think you were born to rule me, but I was born to live free!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|When auntie said 'strong women are like steel', she was right!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|You think empire means strength, Darius? Grow up, boy.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|The worst monsters were once human.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Garen. All privilege, no eyes.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Hey there, little furry cave thing. Are you lost?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|No, no-no-no-no! Keep those scissors away from my clothes.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Don't hold back, Jax. Let me learn, from the best.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|'A brighter tomorrow', Jayce? For all, or for those like you?
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Great beast, you kill to survive; so must I.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Nasus! You watched your kindkillmy people. Never again!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Nilah, you slay monsters—impress me, and we team up.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|A grumpy old goat? People will follow any 'gods' these days.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|The man who made gods bleed. Show me, Atreus.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|You are baccai, are you not...? 'Ok'? Is that it?!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Renekton, your carnage ends now!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|You'll make no trophy out of me, Kiilash.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I see you don't lack confidence, Sett. A shirt, maybe?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Sivir, don't let your bloodline determine who you are!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Hello, colonizer! How do you wish to die today?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You weave the land's gift, Taliyah. Cherish it.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The Void, is it? All monsters can be slain.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|The lives lost, the baccai—all victims of your pride, Xerath.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Good weapons have many uses!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I'll give you a laugh... So few ever do!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|There's your comeuppance.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Ascended no more.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|No 'chicken' should play emperor.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Jax! Don't use age as an excuse.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I went all out. You did not.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|All those books, Nasus... For what?!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|And now, Atreus, return to your hearth.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Formis temporary,classis permanent
wavs/audio_0082.wav|God-warrior Renekton, butchered by a man.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Gold can't buy everything, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Nothing justifies massacre, Xerath. Nothing!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|It wasn't close.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Good! Who's next?
wavs/audio_0087.wav|No challenge.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|When one hunt ends, another begins.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|We're finished here.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|All bark. No bite.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|K'Sante laughs.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Some of us won't see the end. Remember the fallen, as you draw the enemy's blood.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Hehe, we don't have to be friends. But wedohave to fight, together.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|As much as I wish, a single head can't hold counsel. So please, march with me.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|K'Sante. Hear my name, and know my strength.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Keep your heads high—we are worthy!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|My ancestors built Nazumah. No god, king, or beast could conquer them; andnonewill conquer me.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I'm grateful for the love we shared, but I'm thankful to walk my own path.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|We were friends, then lovers, then a path... Some hunts fail; some love stories, too.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|In life and in battle, I remember my mistakes. They are my history; my motivation.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|If Tope were here, he'd point out all my mistakes. Good thing we separated—because he'd be right!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Even now, my people stand with me. My weapons aimed in their name.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Mother would love this, eh? Her only son, fighting to the death!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Heroes are born from crisis.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Haha, see the way they scramble like baby armadillos!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Shift like the sand. Strike like the eagle.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Roarwith every step.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Here, I make my truth.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I will push them back. Alone, if I must.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Every scar, a lesson.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|"""Survival is just the beginning!"
wavs/audio_0112.wav|The desert was my mentor.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Hehe, it wouldn't be worth it if it were easy!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Open battle honors the hunt.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Act like failure is impossible.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Anyone can wield a weapon! Warriors make their own.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Iam the vanguard.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|If the enemy asks—I am the answer.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Those who don't respect me will learn today.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|'Surrender' is a weakling's word.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Predators become prey, as quickly as night becomes day.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Ascended, warlords, monsters, they are not so different.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Good is not enough.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|No monster greater than pride.

wavs/audio_0137.wav|Crumble!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Enough!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Face me, fight!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|To dust.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Fall!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Die!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|K'Sante grunts loudly.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|K'Sante groans loudly.

wavs/audio_0150.wav|You are finished!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|I will not yield!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|A sound I know well.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|The hunt beckons.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|It calls. I go.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Remember the cobra-lion. I didn't give up then. Iwon'tnow.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Those who wish me dead... Keep wishing!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|I am not dead. Not yet.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Like my ntofos—break me, and I return stronger!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Why didn't they– No matter; so long as I am here, we can win!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Not a chance I lose to the likes of you.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Big egos fall the hardest.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Move!
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Get out.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Back up!
wavs/audio_0167.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|K'Sante grunts.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|K'Sante grunts.
