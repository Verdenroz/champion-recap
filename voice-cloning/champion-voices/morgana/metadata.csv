wavs/audio_0001.wav|Your worst decisions will haunt you.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Justice, how boring!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Attacking me with my own blade, sister?
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Judge yourself, sister!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|True justice needs compassion!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Justice, how boring!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Justice is never blind!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|A sword! Cute.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Justice, how boring!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|I make my own justice!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Own your frailty!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Feel my pain!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Embrace your pain!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Endure!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Embrace your mistakes!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Do not look away!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Feel your guilt!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Darkness rises!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Revel; you are alive!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Darkness is a gift!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Do not run from your shadow!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Endure this!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Feel!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Suffer!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Darkness reveals truth!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Suffer or feel nothing!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Into the dark!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Share in my torment!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Know me by my pain!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Suffer as I have!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|I will show you pain!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Avoid pain, suffer more!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Feel something, anything!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Suffer as I have!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|I make my own justice!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Own your frailty!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|What's new?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Not even for your twin?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You never do.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Sister. Here to break my heart anew?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Kayle, have you forgotten our father?
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Sister. You broke our family and my heart.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Mother must be so proud of all your murders, Kayle.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Ugh, you again.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|What have you done with mother's sword?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|You mask your feelings, Kayle, because you have none.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Remember strolling together in the woods, when we were girls?
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Funny. I remember it differently...
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I never did.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|At least I haven't smited all my friends.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I need no blade.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Why do we have feet if not to tread upon the soil.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|We've never been enemies, sister.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|How tragic yours to believe them.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Or large... squirrels?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I am your salvation!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Preach later!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Kayle!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Kayle. Still the same hair after what, a few hundred years?
wavs/audio_0060.wav|You hide behind your laws in arrogance, Kayle.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|It takes a cold heart to abandon your family.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Do not run from your shadow, Kayle.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Oh, am I pure now, sister?
wavs/audio_0064.wav|So this... is how it feels...
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Ahh... something new...!
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Shielded from yourself.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|You thought my magic evil.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Shielded from yourself.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Shielded from yourself.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|You're welcome.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Demacian lies are pretty.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Demacian faith is a hollow shield.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Those who wear armor fear death, Garen. And that's a lot of armor.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Those you love can destroy you, Jarvan.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|LeBlanc. Wish my twin would disappear as fast as yours.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Your secrets are why you suffer, Lux.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|There is darkness in everyone, Lux. Even you.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|A metal heart still breaks.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Your soul sings for a fallen world, Sona.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I saw you in your cell, Sylas. Heard your cries. Felt your anguish.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Did someone send you here as a joke, Yordle? Did Kayle send you?
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Darkness reveals our truth, Zed.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Let me show you what it is to fall.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me not. Loves me!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me... not. Ughh.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Time to come down to earth.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Send my regards to mother.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Blood for my blood.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|They wanted a villain, I gave them a villain!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Mortality is truly divine.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Pain must be felt.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Take pride in how swiftly we fall.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Kayle, blinded by the shadows your light casts.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I will not disappear, as much as Kayle would like me to.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I am unmade in the image of my twin.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Kayle. I know her soul. She broke my heart.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I shall battle my heartless twin once more.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|You demean yourself to fight amongst the mortals, Kayle.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|They shall feel my pain, and fear for their souls.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|They are not ready for the reflections within my darkness.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Humans are inherently flawed, and yet I trust them more than the divine.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|With each step I forge my fate in the fires of pain.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|True grace is beautiful in its imperfection, honest in its emotion, freed by its own frailty.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|The trials I endured were seared into my soul, they drive me forward even after my wounds have healed.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Wings bound and feet earthly tethered, I move against the false promises of order and justice.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|We may fall today, but still we persist.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I move with mortals while she languishes with her lofty ideals
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Once I thought the air above was sweet. Now... I find it stifling.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|To see the world in black and white is to blind yourself to all of life's colors.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Nothing makes you feel alive like knowing you might die.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I have seen liars choose virtue and I have seen the divine cheat. Perhaps today I will see a Yordle sneeze.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|My sister cauterized her wound in holy fire. Mine remains.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I prefer an honest sinner over a righteous liar.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Those who soar amongst the clouds lose sight of the life below.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|My broken heart still beats.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|My wings are bound, but my soul flies.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|I did not fall from grace, I leapt.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Not all light is a gift.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I know what my enemies feel. They are right to be afraid.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I walk so I can feel each fracture of the earth.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Demacia learned all the wrong lessons.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|My shadow outruns my sister's light
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Truth is a dark mirror.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I find beauty in these shadows.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Some pray to fate. I forge my own path.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Pain is grace.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|My wings remember the wind. No longer.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Hmm, battles bring out so many emotions.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Do not conflate darkness with evil.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Righteousness. A splintered shield that I will shatter.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Justice is a lie of the powerful. I have truths of my own.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|I would cut off my wings if there were steel strong enough.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|We are shaped by our foes.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I chose my shackles.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|I was betrayed, once.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Only those you love, can break your heart.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|To love is to be bound.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|With every step I forge my own fate.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Shadow is not as dark as one might think.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Mistakes shape us.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Betrayal never comes from your enemies.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I shall show them what it is to fall.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Once I had grace, now I have pain.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Only death can break my bonds. And I... am immortal.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|You cannot break a shattered soul.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|My wings are heavy, but not as heavy as my heart.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|We are the sum of our mistakes.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Whether by chains or by wings, we are all bound.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|This world is all I have.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|My flaws are a badge of honor.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Some call me evil. Shall I prove them right?
wavs/audio_0152.wav|I will not forsake the land that shaped me. Nor the mistakes.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Those who judge condemn themselves.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|To walk barefoot, skin to soil, is true grace.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Onward through this unchanging land.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I don't hide my pain, I wield it.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Demacia forgot the true cost of war. I remember.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Feel this!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Remain!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Be still!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|I told you to remain!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Look What You Made Me Do
wavs/audio_0163.wav|I suffered this for you!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I will take on everything!
wavs/audio_0165.wav|My pain unbound!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Mortal comforts make immortality bearable.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Home, a place that never leaves you.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|I have endured worse.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|These mortal cycles begin anew.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|I know how it feels to fall. So will you.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Shall I remind you of your vulnerability?
wavs/audio_0172.wav|We shall see through their lies.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Darkness is everywhere.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Vision does not require light.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|The world is a beautiful place. Do not let it be hidden.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Circled by your sins!
wavs/audio_0177.wav|The earth reflects your torment!
wavs/audio_0178.wav|I am bound, but I will not break.
