We must all make our choices.
Never become a monster to defeat one.
There is wisdom in war.
None will question our resolve.
Ionia speaks through me.
To conquer one's self is to conquer all.
Act with conviction.
Peace, no matter the cost.
Now we prove our courage.
Indecision is failure.
Focus!
Never falter.
Peace!
We have learned as much as we have suffered.
Never fear change.
My spirit is an unquenchable fire.
Heart and mind as one.
Challenge what you know.
AsIoniachanges, so must I.
We must all make our choices.
The answer lies within.

An ideal is nothing... until you fight for it.
I know your spirit... but I must stop your heart.
Always trust your spirit.
