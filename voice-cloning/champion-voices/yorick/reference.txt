It's your funeral.
That is a lot of flesh to raise.
Even your kind will join the mist.
Yours will be the largest coffin.
I need your essence, great beast.
Your kind is supposed to live long. I am sorry.
Prepare your epitaph.
No eulogy for you.
The beyond awaits you.
You are to die.
“So many souls to liberate."
The mist comes for you.
The grave is your home.
I'll mourn for you.
Die to rise again.
Flesh that will soon find earth.
You decay and do not know it.
To dirt, you return.
Scatter their remains.
I am to bury you.
You will rot.
You are beyond saving.
I will not damn you. I will end you.
To death.
Your tomb awaits.
Respects to the dying.
Your end is nigh.
The sword of a great man.
The king will return for it.
The blade of the father.
This blade has performed great feats.
A sack to cover flesh and bone.
The armor of someone soon to die.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Mere rags, soon to fade.
The dead need no armor, but I do.
Taken from one who can no longer use it.
It fits me to perfection.
Too valuable to bury.
To slow the fleet of foot.
Cold, even to my touch.
As cold as the hand of death.
Red is the heart that barely beats in me.
A vital ornament.
It pulses with life, as theIslesonce did.
Sometimes the dead can give life.
A ghastly armament.
A gift from kind specters.
Stay with me, spirit.
They'll find me hard to bury.
Gives life when death is near.
To cremate my foes.
The fire of life burns within.
The only warmth I've found.
Don't bury me with it. You can't take it with you.
Even a monk needs bread and water.
Material items, for the material world.
I see thewolf.
I grow cold.
Do not grieve.
At last.
Feel its pull.
A profane sacrament.
An unholy mark upon you.
It fouls upon touch.
A curse upon the ground.
It claims you.
They say I was once your age, though I can't quite recall.
Your corpses against mine. May the best win.
I have nothing but time. Show me something else.
Those you ride down will soon rise against you.
You and I share a common goal. The similarities end there.
Enjoy this limbo while you can, for I will soon end it.
One day, you will take me. May it be soon.
I know you. And I see you always.
No, Lucian, I haven't seen your wife.
You remind me that the world is sometimes good... and very naive.
I fight to free you as well, though a hatchet would suffice.
My army will soon storm your gates, revenant.
Yours is a fool's errand. The world must be allowed to die.
You think you want immortality. I'll gladly give you mine.
Those souls are not yours to keep.
I pity what you have become. Shall I end your suffering?
Yours is an easy grave to dig, small one.
Ah, missed it. There it goes! Where is it at— Ah! Yes!
Ah, would you like some friends? Nope, can't have 'em.
I suppose I have eternity to think about that one.
One more nail in the coffin of theIsles.
I can't bury them all.
My graveyard is full.
All these bodies going to waste.
My army grows.
All things decay.
It falls, like all things.
Makes its own tomb.
Everything that stands must fall.
Forward, we press.
Mortar crumbles.
Look at the wrong you do!
Your remains will serve a purpose.
Another voice in the cacophony of wails.
We all end the same.
Flesh torn asunder, flesh reborn.
Ah yes, I remember what laughter sounds like.
Join us in eternity, Yorick.
This land will never heal. But I will lay it to rest.
Tired, ancient, and half-dead. Still, I come for you.
Let us in, remove your chains.
Yorick, look what you've become.
I am the rift between life and death. The thin divide between breath and grave.
Your human form is so confining. You could be infinite.
We see you, Yorick. We know your weakness.
I once had honor... before theRuination.
There is no hope.
I carry these souls to their end... wherever it may be.
Tears of life preserve me.
TheRuined King'sallies shall fall with him.
My curse is our only hope.
What hell is worse than this limbo?
I do not live in hope. I work to return it.
The dead don't hear you, no matter how you cry.
One can stare into the grave too long.
Soon, this depravity will end.
This journey is long, but I will complete it.
These isles... how they scream.
We shall prevail. We have eternity.
Tell me of the beyond... in case I never make it.
Death is not to be feared.
The dead have not forgotten.
They once called these isles undying. Yet die, they will.
From the ground they come, and to it, they return.
All things fade... but me.
The beyond is waiting. Strive to meet it.
Everyone I knew is dead. How are things with you?
How quick the turn from blessed to cursed.
Death used to mean something.
Our souls are a small price to pay to cleanse this land.
Ours is a fate worse than death.
I am no tyrant. These souls act on their own.
Hallowed or profane... I no longer know.
We're dead much longer than we are alive.
I go wherever souls are adrift.
The constant wailing of souls in torment.
So many souls, so few bodies.
It hurts to remember.
What I do is just. Every horrid piece of it.
What a beautiful dream is life.
I remember when I put theminthe ground.
I do not know what lies beyond. But it is better than this.
Water for the living, shovel for the dead.
If they could see what I see, they'd long for death.
To most, life is fleeting; to me, it is quagmire.
Death is not always a release.
TheRuined Kingwill soon meet the victims of his curse.
But for the waters, the mist would take me.
I am the first and last of my order.
Do you hear that? It is the end.
I cling to life by the thinnest thread.
The Mist writhes, searching for a place to take root.
The dead shall forgive me. I hope.
It is to the grave, we go.
The isles were once paradise; now they're a prison.
This mist has become skin.
Life is but a brief disinterment.
Join me, brother.
Die with me brothers, and be free.
Arise and return to this world.
Walk once more.
A little longer, friend, then rest.
Rest in your rightful place.
It's good to see you.
Wake up. You have a new task.
Welcome back, you won't be here long.
Allies from below.
Hello, friends.
Some of these faces I know well.
Ah yes, I remember you.
This horde consumes all.
Return, and fight.
I thank you for your service.
Kill, and use its form.
They rise, they fight, they rot.
I shall perform your rites!
What's one more grave?!
The isles remember!
I must dig!
One more step toward domination!
Do you feel it? I ammore!
We feed, we grow!
We are stronger. We shall take all!
Go, take what you will.
Behold the horrors of theIsles!
See the Maiden? She comes foryou.
Do not resist.
The mist takes all!
More, more for the black maw of the mist!
We are not corruption. We are strength!
All will join.
Submit. Surrender.
We devour it. It becomes us!
Yorick's theme plays.
Even a monk needs respite.
The bells toll and I respond.
We all return to our origin.
My path is a circle, my work never-ending.
You retreat like a coward.
A breath between rites.
One day, I will no longer awaken.
When we end, we begin again.
A futile act—why do you persist?
Revived by the tears of life.
The shock of resurrection quickly passes.
We do not die, and so we fight on.
The beyond is not given. It is earned.
A fleeting repose.
There will be no requiem. Not yet.
Our time has not yet come.
I've come too far to stay dead.
I no longer feel insults.
I've endured more pain than any words can bring.
I'm just happy to have company.
Ah yes, I remember spewing idle words.
You'll make a fine addition to my cloak.
For you, I won't dig too deep.
To delay the end.
I still draw breath.
To life.
Take shape.
It's you they seek.
The ruins of these isles rise to smite you.
Won't you join them?
The damned resist their fate.
Watch them squirm.
To destroy the curse, I use it.
They reach for you.
This never ends.
An eternal ring.
Fear not... I will make use of your corpse.
