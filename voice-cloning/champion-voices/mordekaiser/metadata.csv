wavs/audio_0001.wav|None can escape me.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Submit.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Death is my kindness.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Accept your demise.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Meet your fate!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Nightfall hungers.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Bow before your damnation!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Your end is nigh.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Forfeit your soul.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|You are already doomed.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|You shall break.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Face mortality!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Fate sealed.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Thus begins the slaughter.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Walking carrion.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Surrender to death.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Face your end.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|No Pain no Gain
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Let the screams begin.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Crush and enthrall.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Desolation.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Death is salvation!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Bend to my will.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|No remorse.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Power eternal.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|I refuse to fade...
wavs/audio_0027.wav|A fleeting delay of the inevitable...
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Yes...
wavs/audio_0029.wav|You... have earned my attention...
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Within my grasp!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|In my clutches.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|No escape.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You claim strength, Darius? Prove it.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Pathetic glory seeker.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|False kings cower beneath false crowns. A true lord takes what he will.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Death has no meaning, Karthus. All that matters is one's purpose beyond it.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Flimsy blades and fancy footwork won't save you, Katarina.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Ah, the Black Rose. I remember your petty manipulations.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Noxians claim strength? Pathetic.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|The same magic that chains you to this realm frees me to walk between.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|You too shall serve me, spirit.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Clutch your borrowed power, Grand General. Your soul is already mine.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Ah, Veigar. Such exquisite torment I gifted you.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Vladimir. You are nothing but a stain splattered on the pages of history.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I know your secrets, little ones. Even you cannot escape me.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Resist or give in, your end is the same.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|You will be far more useful in death.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Your false gods cannot save you.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Adorable...
wavs/audio_0050.wav|All shall serve the true lord of the living and the dead!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Clearly, your ambition outpaced your ability.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Iron shatters stone.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|All things raised by mortal hands will fall.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|These monuments mean nothing to me.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Your eternity begins.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Such meaningless struggle.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You were correct to fear.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|In the end, I claim all.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|A fine addition to my collection.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Messy.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|What I want, I take.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Eternal servitude.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Harvest the worthy. Discard the chaff.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Naive men pray to the gods. They will learn to pray to me.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|The world has tried to forget my existence. Time to remind them why they fear.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I have bent the realm of the dead to my will. This world shall be next.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I alone am the bastion between eternal existence and oblivion.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|So many blunder on with a false sense of purpose. I shall sunder them from their lies.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|The din of the living world. The silence of the hereafter. I rule it all.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Once, I suffered a mortal body. Now, I am iron incarnate.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Some fear me. Others worship at my feet. All will serve.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I am surrounded by weak and petty souls, clinging to flesh.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Soon, Nightfall shall feast.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Every soul shall serve.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Only the worthy receive the gift of Nightfall's kiss.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Malice never wanes.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Let the foolish curse me.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Lives are temporary. I stand eternal.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|The dead belong to me. The living shall be next.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Shed the frailty of flesh. Embrace the cold edge of iron.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Twice slain, thrice born.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|All will bend their knee in fear and fealty.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I will grind their petty souls into mortar.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|So be it... Jedi
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I march towards endless glory.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Weaklings cower in the light. I bring eternal darkness.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I will silence the incessant thrum of mortal hearts.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Death does not tire.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I sunder the natural cycle, so that all may be preserved.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Expunge mortality.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I left the husk of mortality behind.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|All mortals reek with the stench of decaying flesh.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|All will die. All will be mine.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Their gods cannot save them... from me.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Flesh constrains. Iron liberates.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Fools fear death. The strong wield it.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|All souls are forfeit.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I raise my iron fist to subjugate the living.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I promise eternity.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|The ungrateful call me tyrant. The wise call me lord.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Mortals plan in fear for tomorrow. I build for eternity.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The unworthy are dust, doomed to wither and fade.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I forged Nightfall from mortal terror.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Shatter!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Crumble!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|See the truth and despair.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Destruction unchained.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Enter the crucible of anguish.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Through the darkened gate.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Mine for all eternity.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Welcome to oblivion.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Finality approaches.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Cherish the respite.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|My return will seal their doom.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|The realm beyond beckons.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|My will is once again bound to iron.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Death cannot hold me.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Unfettered by mortality.

wavs/audio_0132.wav|Unbreakable.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Iron stands eternal.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Such paltry blows.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Destiny. Domination. Deceit.
