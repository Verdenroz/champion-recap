Going.
The inferno begins!
The fires of vengeance.
Their scars will be warning.
I purify this one!
Forged in pain!
Burn! Hahaha!
Burn! Hahaha!
This body is just one of many!
You can't contain me, summoner!
After millennia, I am free!
Yes...
Like wildfire.
Going.
I'm on a short fuse.
I will blaze a trail.
I am the fire that cleanses the world!
Is that fireproof?
Ready to set the world on fire? Heheheh...
