You reek of fear!
I'll use their bones to pick my teeth.
I must be sated!
I will kill you all!
Give me an enemy.
My axe is getting cold!
I'll pull you apart!
Blood will spill!
Your life is mine!
Bleed for me!
I'll whet my axe on your bones!
I'll drown you in your own blood!
I'll rip the meat from your bones!
Ally, enemy... I don't care.
I'll rip your head from your spine!
Drink their blood!
Your cries disgust me!
Raise your weapon!
I'll grind you to dust!
Run from me!
I'll drink from your skull!
I taste blood in the air.
Killing, I know.
They'll never find all your pieces.
Another corpse for the pile.
I will ruin you.
More enemies!
I will break you!
No mere spell will stop me.
A sword lacks heft.
This cleaver... will be red soon.
This is not the first dead king's weapon I've taken.
It longs to kill.
Nothing will keep me from battle.
Every step will crack the earth.
Good enough to stomp insects.
These will wade through the blood of thousands.
I'll shatter the gates of Demacia with this hammer!
Cold as the grip of death!
I'll feel their bodies grow cold.
This will stop their flailing!
Ah... cold fear.
Do you feel a shiver down your spine?
This will sever a thousand heads.
Spells... hmph.
They will break first.
Protection from the bites of gnats.
A dark omen for my enemies!
All will burn in my wake.
Fire... good...
They'll beg as they burn.
Leave no wound unanswered.
This has seen many battles.
This is the only fortress I need!
Battle scarred... I like it.
This was made for war, as am I!
I'll bury it in their skulls.
Hand it over before I kill you.
If it breaks, so will you.
I'll break it in.
It will do.
Another trinket to be shattered.
I will drench it in their blood.
The spoils of war.
Out of my way!
Worms!
You can't hide behind lackeys!
Scatter!
You're mine!
Is this what passes for war?!
Get up! Fight!
I know you... I want to remember killing you!
One of us will finally die today!
Time to cut your strings, puppet!
We've clashed a thousand times... no more!
Next in line, next to die.
I killed you once... I'll kill you again!
Today, we'll see if ghosts can bleed.
I'll plant that banner in your corpse!
You will be privileged to die... under my boot!
I am not your pawn, Swain!
You are weak, Swain! You are no leader!
You are not my general!
How many Jarvans must I kill?
Four Jarvans, and you're all still failures! That is funny.
You look just like your ancestor: dead!
Why don't I have coverage for prosthetics?
So, uh, Urgot. We can't hang out any more. I'm cool now.
I had a funny bone, then I crushed it. Laugh, worm!
Your puny body is the only joke here.
Your... puny body is the only joke here.
The mewling of your orphan children amuses me! How's that for funny?
It's clobbering time!
Battle... yes!
When does the killing start?
It's been too long.
I hate this waiting.
The quiet... eats at me.
Always marching.
Where are they?
I... do not bleed.
No... pain... no... feeling... but hunger...
Our drums will drown out their screams.
Slay the strong, trample the weak!
Winning is like breathing.
Break their will and their bones.
Blood is the wine of victory.
Noxus suffers no cowards.
What toll have I paid?
Cowardice will be met with death.
Only cowards fear death.
Forget the faces of the slain.
Victory is soaked in blood.
Death had its chance.
These wounds bring no pain.
This hunger... it gnaws.
How many battles have I won?
What am I?
Where is the thrill of carnage?
I need a slaughter!
Why do I feel... nothing?
Shattered earth and bodies!
Broken stone, broken bones!
A black eye for the earth!
You are worms!
Leave no stone unbroken!
Quake and die!
Die and be silent!
Crumble!
You're nothing!
Even the ground trembles!
Feel that?
Cowaaaaards!
Noxus!
Nothing will stop me!
Dieeeeee!
I... Am... War!
Vermin!
I'll crush you all!
There's death to deal.
The enemy awaits.
This battle is done.
They can cower a little longer.
I don't care what your name is!
Your snapping bones are music to my ears!
Come out and die!
More grist for the mill of war!
Your bones will pave my road to glory!
You reek of fear!
Where are you going? Nowhere!
This is the ground you'll die on!
Running is futile!
A trap for vermin.
Show me the enemy.
Let them sneak, then let them die.
Is that all?
The din of the dying!
I hear the screams!
Fire in my veins!
My blood burns.
Heat... and... rage!
Think you can takeme?
You can't even scratch me!
Rest is for the living.
