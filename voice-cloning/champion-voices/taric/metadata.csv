wavs/audio_0001.wav|Your judgement is clouded. Seek clarity.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|You seem to have too many heads. Let's see if I can help you with that.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|I know I'm supposed to cherish all life, but come on.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|The taint of the Void is upon you.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Greedy beast.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Let's see how hot things get.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Nothing personal, but you've got to go.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|I will shatter them.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|I serve life, but deal death.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|The stars keep the darkness at bay.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Memories are my worst enemies.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Targon weeps for you.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|This world's fragile beauty must be preserved.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|The mountain endures.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Let me make myself crystal clear.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|I climbed Mount Targon. You did not.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|The heavens strike swiftly.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|These gems aren't just for show.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Gems always hold their edge.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|The stars care not.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|To protect all.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Beauty and life.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Wither in my radiance.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|This crystal will never crack.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Beauty can stir one's heart... or stop it.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Don't worry, I am here.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Steven Universe
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Just like the old days.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Memories of Demacia.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|That's a face I'll never forget.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Let's test this promise.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Good armor, bad name.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Not that I'll need this.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|This will match nicely.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Something to accent my chest.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|A cold shoulder indeed.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Work of an artisan.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Frozen beauty is still beauty.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Not true Targonian. Still nice, though.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|So misguided, those Solari.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Feels right.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Targon is always with me.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|The mountain makes beautiful things.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Shuriman, eh?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|The finest craftsmanship.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I thank the mountain for its gifts.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Fits well.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Can't say no to a ruby.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Ruby for vigor, eh?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|My kind of stone.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Natural gem enhancement.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Can never be too warm... or too beautiful.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Wish I'd had this on the mountain.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|The sun's embrace is welcome.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Fight fire with fire.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I will hurl them back with their own weapons.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Just in case.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Mind your step.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Look sharp.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|What's a 'mog' anyway?
wavs/audio_0062.wav|You can always use a little extra protection.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Better safe than sorry.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|The sands of life.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Divination indeed.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|A fine addition.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Money well spent.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Always useful.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|And one of these...
wavs/audio_0070.wav|My light never dims...
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Say hello to my little gems.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Gems hurt, don't they?
wavs/audio_0073.wav|For Targon.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Blind them with our light.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Gems are wonderful distractions.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|A little glimmer in their eyes.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Let me show you something.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Clarity.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|That bow is of the stars, as is its mistress.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|No star should be bound.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Who could have guessed the Aspect of the Moon would be so beautiful?
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Own your destiny, or it will own you.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Good to see you again, old friend.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I will never turn my back on Demacia.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I bend knee to no king.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|The heavens see all you have done.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Shine on, you crazy diamond.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|The sun is but a traveller through the kingdom of the stars.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Ah, the Aspect everyone hates.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|You are weighed down by your petty hungers.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I like the cut of your gem.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Are you even wearing pants?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I will enjoy sending you back to the Void. In pieces.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I will purge the Void from this world.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Beauty can be deadly... and manly. Very manly.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Truly Outrageous
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Well, that was refreshing.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Beauty is a job well done.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Never a dull day.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Looks like a mountain fell on them.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Fade and begone.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|There is great power in the stars. Great danger as well.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Crash the mountain upon them.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|The most precious jewel is the one we hold in our heart.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|There's nowhere left to go but up.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The climb may be long, but the view is worth it.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I've been to the top of the mountain... and the bottom of the gutter. There's much to learn from both.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I have risen beyond the call of banners and kings.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|The heavens guide me.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Each life is a rare jewel.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I may be merciful, but Targon isn't.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|I am no longer the man I once was.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Just as the mountain is eternal, so is hope.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|We're all headed toward the same inevitable end. No need to rush.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Easy on the eyes? Don't I know it.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The mountain's mysteries are known to me.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|The mountain's question is unique for each of us.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Why is it always the ugly ones?
wavs/audio_0121.wav|True gems sparkle even in the absence of light.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Truth is worth fighting for, but beauty is worth dying for.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|To truly see the stars, I climbed.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Sometimes, life is worth dying for.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|The mountain reveals the harshest truths in our souls.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|The Protector speaks through me.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Elegance never helped win a fight, but it never hurt.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|The stars freed me from myself.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|The stars were the question. I was the answer.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Demacia was my home, but the stars are my destination.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|We see beauty in the stars, and they see beauty in us.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|The best weapons are beautiful.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The mountain showed me my path.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Human life is fleeting, a mountain's life less so, but stars... stars are eternal.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|My heart is filled with starlight. I give it freely to all.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Love is simply beauty crystallized.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Bask in the glow.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|We must serve life.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|A little something from Targon.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Rest easy.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Embrace the cosmos.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Shake the pillars of heaven.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Let's climb that mountain, shall we?
wavs/audio_0145.wav|An Aspect's work is never done.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Challenges await.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|No, I didn't see stars.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Failure has always been my greatest mentor.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|No rest for the chosen of Targon.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Let me broaden your worldview.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|I bested the mountain. Now it's your turn.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|I answered for my crimes. Now it's your turn.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|An Aspect still needs help, now and again.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I can see my mountain from here.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|One can always use extra clarity.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Oh, the sights we'll see...
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Always forward.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Honor the mountain.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Fight on.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Stand against them.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|For beauty!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|The fight never ends.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Up the mountain we go!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Vigor!
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Crack their resolve.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Never submit.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|That glimmer of hope you see, that's me.
