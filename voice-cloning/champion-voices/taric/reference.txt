Your judgement is clouded. Seek clarity.
You seem to have too many heads. Let's see if I can help you with that.
I know I'm supposed to cherish all life, but come on.
The taint of the Void is upon you.
Greedy beast.
Let's see how hot things get.
Nothing personal, but you've got to go.
I will shatter them.
I serve life, but deal death.
The stars keep the darkness at bay.
Memories are my worst enemies.
Targon weeps for you.
This world's fragile beauty must be preserved.
The mountain endures.
Let me make myself crystal clear.
I climbed Mount Targon. You did not.
The heavens strike swiftly.
These gems aren't just for show.
Gems always hold their edge.
The stars care not.
To protect all.
Beauty and life.
Wither in my radiance.
This crystal will never crack.
Beauty can stir one's heart... or stop it.
Don't worry, I am here.
Steven Universe
Just like the old days.
Memories of Demacia.
That's a face I'll never forget.
Let's test this promise.
Good armor, bad name.
Not that I'll need this.
This will match nicely.
Something to accent my chest.
A cold shoulder indeed.
Work of an artisan.
Frozen beauty is still beauty.
Not true Targonian. Still nice, though.
So misguided, those Solari.
Feels right.
Targon is always with me.
The mountain makes beautiful things.
Shuriman, eh?
The finest craftsmanship.
I thank the mountain for its gifts.
Fits well.
Can't say no to a ruby.
Ruby for vigor, eh?
My kind of stone.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
Natural gem enhancement.
Can never be too warm... or too beautiful.
Wish I'd had this on the mountain.
The sun's embrace is welcome.
Fight fire with fire.
I will hurl them back with their own weapons.
Just in case.
Mind your step.
Look sharp.
What's a 'mog' anyway?
You can always use a little extra protection.
Better safe than sorry.
The sands of life.
Divination indeed.
A fine addition.
Money well spent.
Always useful.
And one of these...
My light never dims...
Say hello to my little gems.
Gems hurt, don't they?
For Targon.
Blind them with our light.
Gems are wonderful distractions.
A little glimmer in their eyes.
Let me show you something.
Clarity.
That bow is of the stars, as is its mistress.
No star should be bound.
Who could have guessed the Aspect of the Moon would be so beautiful?
Own your destiny, or it will own you.
Good to see you again, old friend.
I will never turn my back on Demacia.
I bend knee to no king.
The heavens see all you have done.
Shine on, you crazy diamond.
The sun is but a traveller through the kingdom of the stars.
Ah, the Aspect everyone hates.
You are weighed down by your petty hungers.
I like the cut of your gem.
Are you even wearing pants?
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I will enjoy sending you back to the Void. In pieces.
I will purge the Void from this world.
Beauty can be deadly... and manly. Very manly.
Truly Outrageous
Well, that was refreshing.
Beauty is a job well done.
Never a dull day.
Looks like a mountain fell on them.
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Fade and begone.
There is great power in the stars. Great danger as well.
Crash the mountain upon them.
The most precious jewel is the one we hold in our heart.
There's nowhere left to go but up.
The climb may be long, but the view is worth it.
I've been to the top of the mountain... and the bottom of the gutter. There's much to learn from both.
I have risen beyond the call of banners and kings.
The heavens guide me.
Each life is a rare jewel.
I may be merciful, but Targon isn't.
I am no longer the man I once was.
Just as the mountain is eternal, so is hope.
We're all headed toward the same inevitable end. No need to rush.
Easy on the eyes? Don't I know it.
The mountain's mysteries are known to me.
The mountain's question is unique for each of us.
Why is it always the ugly ones?
True gems sparkle even in the absence of light.
Truth is worth fighting for, but beauty is worth dying for.
To truly see the stars, I climbed.
Sometimes, life is worth dying for.
The mountain reveals the harshest truths in our souls.
The Protector speaks through me.
Elegance never helped win a fight, but it never hurt.
The stars freed me from myself.
The stars were the question. I was the answer.
Demacia was my home, but the stars are my destination.
We see beauty in the stars, and they see beauty in us.
The best weapons are beautiful.
The mountain showed me my path.
I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
Human life is fleeting, a mountain's life less so, but stars... stars are eternal.
My heart is filled with starlight. I give it freely to all.
Love is simply beauty crystallized.
Bask in the glow.
We must serve life.
A little something from Targon.
Rest easy.
Embrace the cosmos.
Shake the pillars of heaven.
Let's climb that mountain, shall we?
An Aspect's work is never done.
Challenges await.
No, I didn't see stars.
Failure has always been my greatest mentor.
No rest for the chosen of Targon.
Let me broaden your worldview.
I bested the mountain. Now it's your turn.
I answered for my crimes. Now it's your turn.
An Aspect still needs help, now and again.
I can see my mountain from here.
One can always use extra clarity.
Oh, the sights we'll see...
Always forward.
Honor the mountain.
Fight on.
Stand against them.
For beauty!
The fight never ends.
Up the mountain we go!
Vigor!
Crack their resolve.
Never submit.
That glimmer of hope you see, that's me.
