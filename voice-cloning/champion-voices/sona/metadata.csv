wavs/audio_0001.wav|Dissonance.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Someone's feeling it.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Right on queue.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Two hearts in three-four time.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Don't make me get off stage.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|I'll help you find your seat.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|If you insist.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|A sublime duet.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Wrong key!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|We've got a heckler.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|An aggressive movement!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Your pitch is off.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I'm not looking for notes.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|The fanfare ascends.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Quiet, please!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Delicately.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Harmoniously.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|A symphony of justice.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Back off.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Keep your voice down!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|With perfect tempo.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You've struck a bad chord.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Here's your show.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Order through music.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Double time!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Triple time!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Step lively.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Hold that note.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Pick up the pace!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Accelerated movement.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Fiddlesticks? But the songs, they can't be real.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Is that Irelia? I haven't seen her since the restoration.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Why won't Jarvan act? All it would take is a single decree.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Am I supposed to know this person? Is he a... fan?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|A Crownguardanda mage? Wouldn't want to be her.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|And where has Ryze been? Hunting for more world ending relics?
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Oh. Is the grand general a fan?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Sylas? He hasn't changed. And my answer is still no.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|It's good to see Taric hasn't changed. And bad. It's both.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|There's so much pain in Xin Zhao's heart. Why?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Just keep smiling and... Maybe they'll go away.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|When fields lie calm, and wind stands still. Run home.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Sorry Garen, but I can't help if I'm locked up.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I don't think Ionia will be rushing to invite me back.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|A single decree and he just wouldn't do it.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Did he want four autographs? I don't understand.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Don't worry Lux. One day, our kind will be free.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Those artifacts can't really end the world Ryze, right?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Good. Mages have enough problems without you Sylas.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Get up Taric. You're chewing the scenery.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|We're both a long way from home Xin Zhao. Rest easy.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Ugh. That wasn't part of the show.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Oh, they'll be fine.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Just an intermission I hope.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Ugh, hecklers.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Everyone's a critic.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|I never could refuse an empty stage. Not even this one.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Haha. I can never shake the nerves before a big performance.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Curtains up. I'm ready.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Mastery is the first step. The rest is what you do with it.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|My music warms old souls and soothes hardened hearts. It is my greatest joy.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Demacia is my home, but I will never forget Ionia.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Strings move, and people dance in time with the memories.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Art bridges the gaps between people. Governments, not so much.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Magic is like a song. It's woven into everything. Waiting.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|This is no ordinary instrument. More like an old friend.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|The world is cruel. Until that changes, I'll never stop playing.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|A wrong note is just...a happy little accident.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Hear and feel everything
wavs/audio_0070.wav|My music is my voice.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Stir the music of the heart.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I'll play any stage once. Some, just the once.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|A melody to guide us home.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|King or commoner, everyone loves a show.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The right song can soothe the soul of a nation.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Never be afraid to listen.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|The rhythm connects us all.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Practice makes perfect.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|A true masterpiece should celebrate living.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I find inspiration in every smile and every tear.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|The joy of an audience is always worth it.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Life is a beautiful ballad.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Hmm, which arrangement suits the mood?
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Emotion, love, those are the real instruments!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|The symphony never ends.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Art is something everyone can share.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|The tempo changes and so do we.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Again!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Open it up!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Dynamic.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Feel it!
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Sempre.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Fortissimo.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Requiem.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Elegy!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Finale!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Symphony!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Once more with feeling.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Oops. Lost myself for a minute.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|A surprise encore? If they insist.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Huh. Sounds like a personal problem.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Just setting up before the next song.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|It's like a little usher.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|You look out for me and I'll look out for you.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Remember to wait for your cue.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Keep and eye out for music snobs.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Every note is important.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Accurate like a metronome.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|A duet.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|In unison.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|You're doing fine.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I've got you.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Play on.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Everything in harmony.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Encore, encore!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|What masterpiece shall we play today?
