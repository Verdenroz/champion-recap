Your commands tire me.
I can see the fear in your heart.
Give up now!
I will swallow your soul!
Even death trembles in my presence.
Your soul will come to serveme.
Iamevil! Stop laughing!
I will swallow your soul!
What's black and blue and is about to show you the definition of pain?!
Suffering awaits.
'It's only a short way'? Is that a short joke?!
I smell death.
Yes! (Laughs)
Your commands tire me.
Stalking prey again?
The magic, it calls to me!
You deny the darkness in your soul! You deny your power!
Know that if the tables were turned, I would show you no mercy!
