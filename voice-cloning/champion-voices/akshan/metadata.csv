wavs/audio_0001.wav|I'm going to remember this.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|You know why I'm here.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You're in deep, friend.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Vengeance with a smile.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Oh come now.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Say your goodbyes.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Defend yourself!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Eyes on the cape.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|You don't deserve life.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|I'm afraid you must pay.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Too late to atone.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is when I shoot you.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You earned this.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Take your comeuppance.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I don't envy you.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Have you no shame?
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Confess!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Scoundrel!
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Any last words?
wavs/audio_0020.wav|You've been naughty.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Tsk, tsk.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Absolve... me.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|That hurts...
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Oh... I see...
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Coming through!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Akshan, away!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Whoosh!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Watch your head!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|It's as fun as it looks.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Heads up!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Hey! Grappling hook buddies! No? Okay, suit yourself.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I know you! You're that kid who stole the gauntlet.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Well if it isn't sentinel serious. Look at all the rules I'm breaking.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Greetings, fellow sentinel! How strange that we are not friends today. Oh, well.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|You work with Viego, yes? Scoundrel by association!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|You're from Shurima? And have a boomerang? We should hang out!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Silly Viego, we can't bring back those we've lost. I mean, I can but... not you.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Sorry, can't let you live. You understand.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Well. You look very guilty of something.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I've got something for you. It's... comeuppance.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I know what you're feeling. It's regret.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|It's not too late to turn around you know.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|I don't know how you live with yourself, but you won't have to for long.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Up, up and... maybe not.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Hahaha! They never expect the grappling hook!
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Consider yourself... absolved.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Now think about what you did.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Always hard taking a life. But I get over it.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|That was quite satisfying.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Yeah. I'd say we're even.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|You know you had that coming, right?
wavs/audio_0053.wav|There, now everyone's happy. Except you.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Shadya would approve of this. I think. You never could tell with her.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|So... this is what it's like to have friends.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|This cape is not up to Sentinel Code. But, neither is the grappling hook, nor the boomerang.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|We are not helpless. We are the ones who shape our destinies. Now, let's go shoot these villains in the face.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|There is no such thing as fate. But there is such a thing as Akshan.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|It's important to stride into the wind so the cape flutters dramatically behind.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Vengeance is not a healthy impulse. Here's to bad health!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Some people say I hold a grudge too long but... those people are dead.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|What else can I add to this gun? Maybe a shovel. No-a ladder!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|How does this boomerang return? Someday I'm going to learn its secrets.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|'Don't use the absolver', they said. 'No one must wield such a weapon'. Eh, I disagree.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Not everything happens for a reason. Some things need to be sorted out.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|You try to rest and some lowlife kills one of your pals. Such is life.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|They take one of mine. I take one of theirs.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Here we go. Get in. Avenge fallen ally. Get out.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|A friend has gone silent. Let's wake them up shall we?
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The bad part about having friends? Always having to avenge them.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I can feel them shaking in their armor. I love this part.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Listen to them. 'Oh no, is Akshan coming to kill me?' Hahahahaha. I am!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Shadya would not approve of this act of vengeance but... she wouldn't approve of a lot of things.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I hear the dead crying out for vengeance. I am coming, friend!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Killing this person won't bring my friend back. Actually, it will! Let's go do that.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|He who takes a life bears its mark on his soul.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Some people just don't want to pay with their lives.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|A villain will show you much when they don't know you are watching.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I once knew someone who followed the rules. She's dead.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I do not break rules. I bend them. Ever so slightly.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Just desserts coming right up.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Curse this nagging conscience of mine.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|A scoundrel left alone will always be a scoundrel.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|People without grappling hooks, what are they thinking?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Once they see me, it is too late for forgiveness.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Who am I to decide who lives and dies? Huh. Just a guy.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Mmm, yes. Villainy is near.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Death? I laugh at death! Ha! Listen to me laugh!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Okay, villains. Time to soil yourselves.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Talk is worthless. We are what we do.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|I've got quite a few tricks up my cape.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I live by my own code. Don't be an ass.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|How well I know the silence of a lonely life.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Huh, nice place. Lotta things to swing from.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Can't talk. Sentinel business. Super important.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Ha ha! The thrill of going where you're not supposed to.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Some people deserve a low blow.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I hate shooting them in the back. I don't get to see their surprise.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Sometimes fate just needs a little nudge.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Things to do. Scores to settle.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|The world won't save itself. You know.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Look at it go!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Ha! Boomerang!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|All in the wrist.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Watch it fly!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|You're going to love this!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Here comes the 'uppance!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Oh, the anticipation!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Oh, so exciting!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Like the mysterious boomerang, I always return.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I come and go at unpredictable times. That is Akshan's thing!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Now for my grand escape. Grappling hook!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Right, then. Up we go!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Only one way out of this mess. Skyward!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Shadya's frowning at me now. I should've paid more attention to her lessons.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Someone gave me comeuppance? Ha! Who do they think they are?
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Yes, yes. The guy who revives people died... I'm really going to hear about this one...
wavs/audio_0120.wav|So... back at square one again. Let us proceed to a better square.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Well. This is embarrassing.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|No shame in starting over! So I tell myself, anyway.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I taunt with my grappling hook. See how it taunts you? Taunt, taunt, taunt...
wavs/audio_0124.wav|I'm back! Take note, evil!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|You're an easy one to find.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Knock, knock. Vengeance calling.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Ha! I have you now.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Miss me?
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Hey! I snuck in.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|That's right. It is I.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|So... how's it going?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Ha! I have sneaked upon you!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Ha ha! Their eyes cannot find me.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Stealth tiiime! I mean... Stealth time...
wavs/audio_0136.wav|To the shadows... where the scoundrels hide.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Ohohoho, I love sneaking.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Sometimes, I even sneak up on myself!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Yes, yes. You can thank me later.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Have a good rest?
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Reclaimed by the light! Yadda-yadda-yadda...
wavs/audio_0142.wav|There you are. Welcome back.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|It was nothing. Really.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|You are reclaimed. Go! Live!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Let's try not to do that again, hm?
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Fixing the world, one scoundrel at a time!
