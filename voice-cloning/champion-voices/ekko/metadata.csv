wavs/audio_0001.wav|You used to be cool.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|This is how we say 'hello' in Zaun.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Good a time as any to act reckless.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Should've walked away.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Welcome to Zaun!
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Make me repeat myself!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Icouldmake this hurt less.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|We'll do it the hard way!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|I'll help you this time. Duck.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Come on! Show me something new!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Keep pushing me.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|All out of warnings.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Time is not on your side!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I like hitting you!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Last chance to be anywhere else.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Haha… you never see this coming.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|A second chance? I thought I was on my fifth!
wavs/audio_0018.wav|I'm sure I won't be needing this… but I'll take it anyhow.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|I love hitting Pilties with their own toys.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|All in. Just my style.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Let's go hunt some liches?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|That is one big tooth.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|And I'm fighting with teeth.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Rabadon must've been a fun guy.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Not much of a hat guy… but this thing is awesome!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Three forces at work.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Triple threat.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|This thing creeps me out.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Can't hide your weak spots from me!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Some things do get better with time.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Yep, this thing has a bright future.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|It's like it was made for me.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|How can I not buy this?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Huh. Freezing time. Interesting.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Stops time? Huh. Thought I'd never get a break.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Go!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Look out!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Scared of a little revolution, Caitlyn?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Aw… who called the cops?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Dibs on the hat!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Go where you want, Mundo... outside of Zaun.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|ZAUUUUUUUUUN!!!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Garen, shouted any good names lately?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I like you better on paper, poster boy.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|I'll never be like this guy.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Nice face. Shame if something happened to it.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Guns. Original.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Ihada crush… until you started talking to the gun.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You're in the wrong neighbourhood.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Run away, little Piltie!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Great. Pilties.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Last warning: go home.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|You give Zaun a bad name.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I lost a pet rat once. Is that you, Mr. Tails?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Take my time machine, Urgot. You clearly need it more.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I'll poke your eye out… head out… face off? How do you even work?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You used to be cool.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Hey, sellout!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|You forgot your roots, Vi.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|You're everything wrong with Zaun.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Never go full robot.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|I'll never be like this guy.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|See? You're part of the problem!
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Think you're Zaun? Prove it.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Zaun's future's about to get brighter.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Timefight!
wavs/audio_0067.wav|I really hope you're not the future me.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? — All of 'em! Hehe…
wavs/audio_0069.wav|How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? — Two, if you count Jayce's reflection! Haha! Oh, Jayce.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? — Zero! They make 'em in Zaun!
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Let me be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Time scramble doesn't travel my brain.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Uh… if anyone sees my paradox, ask 'im where I am.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|This is the longest second of my life.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|The timeline was already this broken when I found it. I swear.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Someone's day's about to get wrecked.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Time to start some trouble.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Ah… that fresh start smell.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Zaun is the future.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I owe them nothing.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|I'd rather make mistakes than make nothing at all.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Not quitting until it's right!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|My pasts have a way of catching up.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|There are always consequences.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|If there are limits… I haven't found them yet.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Never had luck. Never needed it.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|I finish what I start.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Patience? What's that?
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Every rule needs a break.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Time doesn't heal all wounds.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Let's make them notice.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Progress doesn't belong to one city.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Back to going forward.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Fool me once… and I'll just rewind.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|We make the future.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Every second matters.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Tomorrow's the last of my worries.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|No one keeps me down.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I do my own stunts.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Things aren't gonna improve themselves.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Doubt me. I love that.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I hate being responsible.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Think fast!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|One more time!
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Do-over!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Gotta do better than that, law dog!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Were you trying to hit me?
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Next time, shoot where I'm gonna' be!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Swing and a miss, top hat!
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Back before anyone notices.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I need to rethink a couple things.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Taking a breather.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|They'll wish I stayed here.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Second first time for everything!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|That worked in another timeline.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Let's not do that again.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Yep… that went exactly how I didn't want it to go.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Back to square seven.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Note to self: don't touch cop's hat.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Note to self: hammer is actually a gun.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|You gotta teach me that trick, Zil!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I coulda survived that— but thanks anyway.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|One day, you'll come back to Zaun.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|You'll always be Zaun to me.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|So, uh… how about that weather?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I already calculated your odds. Sorry.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Won this fight already. Doing it again for fun.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I've seen your future, and it's got broken bones.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Time snap!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Surprise!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Made it!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Step right up!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Come get me!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|It's not how much time you have, it's how you use it.
