I do not rest.
Embrace death.
Trample their bones.
The living will fall.
Never relent.
The shadow approaches.
War is eternal.
Ride out.
Their souls beg for release.
Send me to battle.
The grave calls.
I do not rest.
I am beyond death.
Cower!
Run!
Terror!
Your life is a burden. I bring you freedom!
You won't live to see your world destroyed.
Face death!
Torment!
Behold, the might of the Shadow Isles.
