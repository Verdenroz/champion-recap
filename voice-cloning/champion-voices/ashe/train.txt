Coward! May you die with your eyes closed.
I will face you, sister.
You face an Iceborn!
Feel winter's sting.
This is my warning to you…!
Fate will treat you coldly!
Never. Lose. Focus!
I do my best work from afar.
Flee from the cold.
You face true ice—you face death.
Fate did not choose you.
As ice shatters, so shall you!
My arrows fly true.
I was raised for war! I am Iceborn.
My aim is steady.
Hmph, the cold does not forgive.
You would challenge an Iceborn?
I greet you; as a Freljordian!
'Thunk'!
My mercy has limits!
I don't miss.
All that frost touches, we know.
Reveal what is hidden.
Show us a path!
Anivia, guide us!
Spirit, reveal our way.
Lead our way.
Anivia, how often have I sought your guidance? And how like a god to betray a mortal's trust!
Braum! What are you doing over there?! Are you drunk?
So, Braum. No shirt, huh? And I don't have pants. Yay, Freljord.
Braum, we are a winter people from a frozen land. So we must… pop it, pop it!
Gragas! Are you blind?! You're on the wrong side…again!
Lissandra, the fate of our people hangs in the balance, and you betray me?!
You named me battle sister and kin, Sejuani. Do not make me fight you!
So, which one is the pig? Kidding!
Trolls are the enemy of mankind! You will die like a beast!
Tryndamere…? What have you become?!
How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow.
Shaman, I am no enemy of the old gods or Sejuani! Must we fight?
Ancient one, go! The Volibear is honored here, but unwanted!
Prepare yourself, you face an Iceborn!
I am Ashe, Daughter of Grena! War mother of the Avarosans!
Know this! I am Ashe! I am the bow!
Hahaha! Check this out… Agh! Ugh, who makes a bow out of ice?!
I don't have to see you to shoot you… Ah, ow! Ugh, oh. Really?!
Sejuani…! Goodbye, sister.
Die, troll. My tribe will destroy your foul race!
Tryndamere, my love. I always suspected this would be our end.
May the voices quiet for you, shaman.
Man no longer needs the Volibear. Return, and I will slay you again.
You fought an Iceborn! Death was the only possible outcome.
Heh. Svaag, I have seen babies fight better than you!
Right between the eyes.
Are all southerners so weak?
They fought an Iceborn, they died.
I only needed one shot.
Svaag, warmblood, was that your best? I killed you without trying.
No one escapes my aim.
No one escapes my bow.
No sagas will mark their passing.
Mark where they died; that was as close as they got.
No one escapes winter.
My mother loved me. She fought and died trying to give me a better life. So I fight, and will die fighting, to give all Avarosans a better life.
Praise Ornn, the Fire bringer. I ask for your wisdom, First Builder and Forge lord.
I loved my mother. I loved my battle sister. I love my people. It is because of this love that I fight.
I dream of the day after the tribes are unified. I dream of no longer needing to lead.
In the North, a great chieftain is called 'Warmother.' Who but a mother has the right to risk lives in war?
Clan or tribe, they will join us. This is the will of Avarosa.
We praise the leader who unifies, forgetting it is only the unity that matters.
The goddess Avarosa… I say I hear her voice. But I hear only my mother's; and mourn her passing.
Praise Anivia, the Frost bringer. Let us feel the coming of change. Grant us the freedom to travel in safety.
Praise Kindred, the Two Hunters. Pray we see death's approach, so we may complete our labors and die with our eyes open.
Hmph, 'destiny'. I have always hated that word. It is a wyrm that ruins lives and murders innocence. It is a deceiver and bringer of woe.
What is it to lead? It is to lie. It is to preach caution even when you are elated. It is to give hope even when you feel none.
Avarosan is the tribe of many, because all Freljordians are one people.
Avarosa speaks one truth, as all gods must. She is our dream of unity.
It is not the goddess Avarosa's glory I wish to recapture; it is our people's.
I have heard no better words than 'The strong must try the impossible.' This is the oath I must fulfill.
The Three Sisters are a myth that has strangled our people. It is a tale of failure.
I am a Warmother—a chieftain—only because no one else will do what must be done.
Bless us, Ildhaurg, Warden of Sacrifice. Protect my husband. Protect my people. If my death pleases you, let it sustain my tribe.
You do not aim a bow at the target, you fire knowing where the target will be. This, is vision.
Blessed Three Sisters. Give me strength to endure what I must. Give me courage to fight who I must. Give me knowledge to see the truth.
Glory to the Volibear, the Thousand-Pierced Beast. Give my people the resilience of your wilderness and the fury of your storm.
I am a War mother. I have given oaths to few. I have taken oaths from many.
My tribe will bring peace to the North! The South should fear us.
They think me cold. I have seen things the Southerners cannot imagine.
I will show them the power of an Iceborn.
The Freljord shall unite!
Together, we are strong. Together, we are … Avarosan.
Gods and spirits guide us. But our lives… are our own.
I am Freljordian. Family, tribe, they are all.
The day our tribes are one, the world will tremble.
Avarosa guide me.
Today, the fate of our people hangs in the balance.
Hearthbound and Iceborn; Spirit Walker and Fireborn; all Freljordians are my kin.
Seek peace, but bring the tools of war.
Do not confuse mercy for weakness.
I will not allow us to be divided. We are one.
No fate is written, except by us.
I was born into poverty—all Freljordians are.
Peace requires a steady hand.
We are all kin of kin. Blood, of blood.
A battle worthy of the Freljord.
When I say Avarosa, I hear my mother, and her dreams…
Swiftly now!
We will unite the Freljord.
I dream of a nation for my people.
Move quickly, position well, and the battle is won before blood is drawn.
My people know only cold and hardship… I will teach them peace.
The bow is my will given form: I am it; it is me.
Lead the target.
What is goodness but trying to do better than your forebears?
There will be peace in the Freljord. I will forge it.
I do not seek the throne of Avarosa.
We must press on!
I hold a bow ofTrue Ice. I hold my heart.
Let's see how close they can get.
The ice is not pain, it is surrender.
This is the fury of an Iceborn!
Faster than my arrows? I think not!
Rain death!
Strike quickly!
Stand together!
I am the bow!
This is the latest in Freljordian fashion. They call it a… skirt.
Take a good look; it's the last you'll get.
This outfit makes total sense, just look closer and think about it… less.
Make it count!
Away!
Arrows, fly!
Can't miss!
Let fly!
I won't miss!
