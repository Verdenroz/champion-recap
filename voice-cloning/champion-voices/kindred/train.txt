You overstep.
Rip them to bits!
Run, if you can!
Lamb calls!
Go easily.
This one is yours.
Life is ours...
Day always turns to...
A careless step...
Mine?
Time to...
Flee, or stand firm.
How one dies shows how one lived.
This will hurt... lots!
Embracing life means accepting death.
You shine brightly.
Depart in peace.
Hush now. Rest.
Drift gently into oblivion.
All sparks kindle new flames.
Panic not when life ebbs.
They break too easy!
No more words!
Tear out the throat!
Ready to chase? Too bad!
They struggle! Good!
Feet tire fast!
Will they run?
Strip away their armor.
Forged in a land unwelcome to us.
It courses with stolen lives.
I thirst more!
They shall not ignore us so easily.
For us, or them?
A sharper blade makes for a cleaner death.
Sharp enough to slice the veil between life and death.
They will see two of me!
Another friend.
Cut them deeper!
They shall only hearmyvoice.
Now!
Mine!
Now!
We understand your loneliness, but...
Pop the balloon!
We know your name, child. Woven across countless almost-lives.
Rushing to meet us again, I see.
Have we met before?
His song sounds good.
Long have we shadowed your deeds.
Trees make a boring chase!
Chase the cat!
Rengar is well-versed in the ways of the hunter.
Come, Sion, let us end this mockery.
Sometimes, death is a blessing.
There are no wolves like me!
Words, words, la la la, pew twang pew!
I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm bored, chase chase chase!
What happens if you miss?
The weft and weave of fate guides... um... uh... how did that poem go again?
Hold still, Wolf.
The chase ends!
All things, great and small...
Return to nothing.
Well hunted, dear Wolf.
If it draws breath...
No match for us!
Fun chase!
Never one...
Have they forgotten us yet, little Lamb?
Every life...
Is this what it feels like to end?
Are you there, dear Wolf?
How old are we, Lamb?
Tell me again, little Lamb, which things are mine to take?
Follow their tracks.
I smell their fear.
None can hide!
What sound do they make?
All things linger...
They race from us!
How long will we be together?
They laugh.
The weft and weave of fate guides—
How does hunger feel?
They know we'll come.
Can't wait for them to flee!
Peacefully, they go.
Those who dread us grant us the most power.
We are not dreams. We are the waking.
"Those who run from death... stood still in life.
Beauty fades. That is why it is beautiful.
Tomorrow is a hope, never a promise.
"There are so many ways to die.
"The only true death is to never live.
Wolf chases what does not willingly go.
Fear makes the chase more fun!
"All will know us... in time.
All who run are mine!
I smell prey!
Hurry, Lamb. Faster.
Bits of them stick in my claws!
None can hide.
I wonder how they see me.
No! That was mine!
How fast can you run?
We shall remember this theft.
What folly it is to snatch our marks.
That was meant to be ours.
You steal from us...
An emboldened thief.
You stole my chase!
You overstep.
Who's next?
We take our mark!
We win!
What do all stories have in common, dear Wolf?
Such befalls all who bear our mark.
That was a good chase!
All life is temporary.
No match for me!
Our mark is lifted.
All your life has led to this moment.
Hahahahaha! That was fun!
When you see us...
Treasure your final moments.
Our mark looms over you.
Your time has come.
Fate hunts you today.
Eternal twilight calls for you.
There you are!
The hunt begins!
Run! Now!
The masks of the Kindred seek you!
We have your name.
This one is ready!
We know your name!
Your next treat, dear Wolf.
I hope this one has strong legs!
This next one will be easy.
Shall we, dear Wolf?
A fine life reaches its conclusion.
I will chase it until it's dead!
Its heart beats fast now!
Their path is destined to cross ours.
Savour life's closing act.
Shine once more, before the end.
Not here, not yet.

The weft and weave of fate guides—
I see water!
It thinks it can beat us!
Choose now:  my arrows...
I'll give you a running start!
Chasing is the best game in the world... and I always win!
Go, Wolf!
Now, Wolf!
My turn!
Never one...
