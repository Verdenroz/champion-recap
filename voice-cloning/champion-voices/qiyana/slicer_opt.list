Qiyana_Original_FirstEncounterMage_1.wav|qiyana|en|Your magic is so primitive. Just like your sense of style.
Qiyana_Original_FirstEncounterMage_2.wav|qiyana|en|Aww, your primitive magic is adorable.
Qiyana_Original_FirstEncounterMage_3.wav|qiyana|en|First time seeing real magic? I'll go slowly so you may follow along.

Qiyana_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|qiyana|en|Cover the ground behind me. None may tread where I have stepped.
Qiyana_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|qiyana|en|I would say 'watch and learn,' but unfortunately you cannot learn this.
Qiyana_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|qiyana|en|Is that all they brought to face us? My omele could defeat them, and she is 85.
Qiyana_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|qiyana|en|I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I'm extremely good, at everything.
Qiyana_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|qiyana|en|I can tell by your expressions you've never met a superior being.

Qiyana_Original_Move_12.wav|qiyana|en|This place will be a lovely addition to my empire.
Qiyana_Original_Move_13.wav|qiyana|en|My feet cannot step where lesser beings have tread.
Qiyana_Original_Move_14.wav|qiyana|en|I hate it when they dare look me in the eye.
Qiyana_Original_Move_15.wav|qiyana|en|I will grant this place the privilege of being conquered by me.
Qiyana_Original_Move_16.wav|qiyana|en|If they want to worship me... hmph, I will not stop them.
Qiyana_Original_Move_17.wav|qiyana|en|'Empress Qiyana...' I do like the sound of that.
Qiyana_Original_Move_18.wav|qiyana|en|Being young means living to see all your enemies die first.
Qiyana_Original_Move_19.wav|qiyana|en|Some people are just born better.
Qiyana_Original_Move_2.wav|qiyana|en|Some wait their turn, and some take what they deserve.
Qiyana_Original_Move_20.wav|qiyana|en|The secrets of my enemies carry far on the wind.
Qiyana_Original_Move_21.wav|qiyana|en|Ugh, this place could use some reshaping.
Qiyana_Original_Move_22.wav|qiyana|en|Line them up. I will bend their knees.
Qiyana_Original_Move_23.wav|qiyana|en|Things do what I tell them to. Right, rocks?
Qiyana_Original_Move_24.wav|qiyana|en|If talent were an element, perhaps I could throw some at them.
Qiyana_Original_Move_25.wav|qiyana|en|No more hiding in the wilderness. I demand to be seen!
Qiyana_Original_Move_26.wav|qiyana|en|You know what's hard about being a princess? Nothing.
Qiyana_Original_Move_27.wav|qiyana|en|Hard work is for those who possess no talent.
Qiyana_Original_Move_28.wav|qiyana|en|My parents rule with fairness and compassion. So boring.
Qiyana_Original_Move_29.wav|qiyana|en|Those who find Ixtal do not live to speak of it.
Qiyana_Original_Move_3.wav|qiyana|en|There will always be someone who is better, and that person is me.
Qiyana_Original_Move_30.wav|qiyana|en|It is a travesty to not be carried by servants.
Qiyana_Original_Move_31.wav|qiyana|en|I do not lack empathy. Other people just need to be better.
Qiyana_Original_Move_32.wav|qiyana|en|I cannot wait to be empress. If only my entire family were not in the way.
Qiyana_Original_Move_4.wav|qiyana|en|I wish there was someone else as perfect as me.
Qiyana_Original_Move_5.wav|qiyana|en|I'm getting hot. Where is my royal fanner?!
Qiyana_Original_Move_6.wav|qiyana|en|
Qiyana_Original_Move_7.wav|qiyana|en|One throne, nine sisters. Nine tragic accidents waiting to happen.
Qiyana_Original_Move_8.wav|qiyana|en|My enemies try their best. That is what is so sad.
Qiyana_Original_Move_9.wav|qiyana|en|Of course I've mastered fire... I just don't like to show off.
Qiyana_Original_Recall_0.wav|qiyana|en|Everyone, your future empress is leaving the fight. ...Okay, carry on.
Qiyana_Original_Recall_1.wav|qiyana|en|Excuse me! ...Uh, excuse me?! Ugh. When I return, this place better have a statue of me.
Qiyana_Original_Recall_2.wav|qiyana|en|Grass? Oh grass? Take me away from this tiresome battle. And can you also fan me?
Qiyana_Original_Recall_3.wav|qiyana|en|Servants, my palanquin. Servants? Ugh, must I do everything myself?
Qiyana_Original_Respawn_0.wav|qiyana|en|Can't keep me in the ground. The ground obeys me.
Qiyana_Original_Respawn_1.wav|qiyana|en|See? Even death is no match for Qiyana.
Qiyana_Original_Respawn_2.wav|qiyana|en|I suppose they will make me do this the hard way.
Qiyana_Original_Respawn_3.wav|qiyana|en|Did anyone see that?  Well, I'll just have to kill them.
Qiyana_Original_Respawn_4.wav|qiyana|en|That was no crushing; that was merely a squeeze.
Qiyana_Original_Respawn_5.wav|qiyana|en|I say give them a win. They're so cute when they think they have a chance.
Qiyana_Original_TauntResponse.wav|qiyana|en|I see you have mastered the element of wind.
Qiyana_Original_Taunt_0.wav|qiyana|en|I can see your weakness; it is just, well, all of you.
Qiyana_Original_Taunt_1.wav|qiyana|en|I have humiliated my own sisters. What do you think I'll do to you?
Qiyana_Original_W_Grass_0.wav|qiyana|en|Oh grass, please hide me from these imbeciles.
Qiyana_Original_W_Grass_1.wav|qiyana|en|I do look good in green.
Qiyana_Original_W_Grass_2.wav|qiyana|en|Brings out my eyes.
Qiyana_Original_W_Grass_3.wav|qiyana|en|They'll never see me coming. What a shame.
Qiyana_Original_W_Grass_4.wav|qiyana|en|This will grow on the graves of my enemies.
Qiyana_Original_W_Grass_5.wav|qiyana|en|As green as the envy of my sisters.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_0.wav|qiyana|en|So many rocks, so many enemies.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_1.wav|qiyana|en|Let us throw rocks at them and laugh.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_2.wav|qiyana|en|Rock is so common. Just like them.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_3.wav|qiyana|en|For crushing.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_4.wav|qiyana|en|Stone, the foundation of empires.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_5.wav|qiyana|en|See? The land knows it is mine.
Qiyana_Original_W_Rock_6.wav|qiyana|en|Oh rock, smash these idiots, won't you?
Qiyana_Original_W_Water_0.wav|qiyana|en|Freeze them in their place!
Qiyana_Original_W_Water_1.wav|qiyana|en|Wet, like the tears of my enemies.
Qiyana_Original_W_Water_2.wav|qiyana|en|Drown them, freeze them, watch them sink.
Qiyana_Original_W_Water_3.wav|qiyana|en|That chill in the air? It's me.
