wavs/audio_0001.wav|Eh, I could do better.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Oooh you look promising.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|On my worst behavior.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I fight on my terms.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Next breath might be your last.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Let's make this fun!
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Bah! Like Tereshni all over again.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Push off.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Oh lookie here. Target practice.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Came all this way to die? Hm?
wavs/audio_0011.wav|You're mine.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Seize the moment!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Settle down sweet-cake.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Don't mess with me.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Well! Look at you.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Think fast!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|I'll take care of this.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|And I'm not even looking.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Finally some action!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Always bet on me.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I'm bored. Fight me!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Don't hold back. I won't.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Push my limits! I dare you.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Least I didn't die of boredom...
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Style never fades...
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Over here!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Eyes up!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Too slow!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Woo!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Keep up!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|The sad mummy! My mﾄ［ﾄ］ used to tell stories about you when I was a girl. How I loved them.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Shurima. Needs. No. Emperor!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I know your type, Draven. The kind of man who's compensating for something.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|That gauntlet would be better off without you, kid.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|You seem kinda pale, LeBlanc. Sure you're getting enough sun?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Sarah, is it? I've killed many captains. Let's see how you measure up.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|A talking turtle? Okay, maybe I did have one too many.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Sivir. You say you'll do anything for the right price, but what's the price of one's destiny?
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Hey, old man. How long you got before that demon takes over?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Honestly, lantern man? Not sure you can handle my soul.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|If it looks like a blood sucker and it sounds like a blood sucker... Maybe I ought to kill it.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Xerath. Your people ended my home. I will end your existence.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Ugh. I missed a freakin' cliff-diving trip for this crap?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Hm. How come no one ever tells me to reload?
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Oh... I really gotta check these more often.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Huh. Less than yesterday at least.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Eh, I'm not here to make friends.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Don't worry, Azir. You'll be remembered... as a tyrant.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Maybe you should've smiled more.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Ah... what was your dumb name again?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Leave the kid, take the gauntlet.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Not the first LeBlanc I've killed. Probably not the last, either.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Your guns have a better home now Sarah.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Ohoho I'm just getting started!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Not sure if I just killed an ascended or some kid's lost pet. Ah, well.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Guess you don't need to run from destiny anymore, Sivir.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Be thankful I got to you before your demon did.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Don't say I didn't warn you lantern man.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Ugh, gross. Least my boots are looking brighter.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Shurima, no, the world is better off without you, Xerath.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Not sorry.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Idiot.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Ha! I win.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Flawless.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|My time is precious. Your life is not.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Lucky for you the last thing you saw was me.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Done and dusted.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Messy, but effective.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|I've got two rules for every fight. Don't ask for permission, don't ask for forgiveness.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Listen up, you sorry lot! Only one rule for this mission: take no prisoners.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|If you can't keep up don't step up. I don't have time for fools.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Name's Samira. Try not to slow me down.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|People always ask about my weapons. Right hand, Blaze. Left hand, Thorn. Vanquish on the back, eh! Simple as that.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Growing up, my mﾄ［ﾄ］ taught me one lesson. Death isn't the scariest thing. It's a mother's rage.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|I care most about my warband or my family. Order changes depending on who gets on my nerves.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Born in Shurima, raised by Noxus. Maybe I'll die in Demacia to make things interesting, huh?
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Sometimes, I'm the hero. Other times, I'm the villain. It's all a matter of perspective.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Those who followed the ascended burned away my home. So don't expect me to follow anyone.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Indari was a great captain. She taught me how to shoot. I taught myself how to kill.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Darius, Swain, pft! Those names mean little to me. I answer to myself.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|If they think I kill for fame and fortune, ha! They're idiots, just like all the others.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I chose this life. And sure, someday it might get me killed... but 'til then, I'm unstoppable.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|I'm the rose that survived the desert.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Danger runs from me.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Money buys a gun or two. Thrill buys a reputation.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Guns and swords go together like rice and saffron.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I don't work. I slay.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|The empire values strength. I value style. We're good partners.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Hope I get some blood on these boots. The color's a bit dull.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I feel most alive when I'm walking the line.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Only need one eye to hit my mark.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Well-behaved women don't make it in Noxus.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Life's simple. Take the shot or lose the chance.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|The ascended think they own my people. They are wrong.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|In every girl, there is a queen.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Last person I loved thought I was too reckless. Their loss.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Why be average when I can be savage?
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Oh, how great it would feel to shoot my past in the face.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Thrilling! Ha! Maybe I'll get a tattoo to celebrate the occasion.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Style
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Heh! Nothing more lethal than comfort.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Some choose steel. Others, bullets. Why not both?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|and
wavs/audio_0105.wav|My folks keep telling me to settle down. Not my style.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|'Refugee.' That label is where I draw my strength.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I'm not built to win. I'm built to conquer.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Virtues? I've got a few. Vices? Heh, a few more.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|It's about to get messy.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|Never look back!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Weapons hot!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|My kind of rain!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|No better time to die!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|How did that old trick go again? Ah, right.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Taking a quick break. Try not to die while I'm gone.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|This took years of practice... for everyone else.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Look out, guys, gals, and other pals. Samira's back!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Live fast. Die young.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Believe me, I've faced worse.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Another round. Ante up!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|It's alright if you don't like me. We can't all have good taste.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Keep the change. You're gonna need it.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Devil May Cry 5
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Buy something nice. On me.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Get a haircut. Trust me.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Nope!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Nice try.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Don't think so.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|You want style? You've found her.
