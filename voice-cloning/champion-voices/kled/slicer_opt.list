Kled_Original_KillJhin_2.wav|kled|en|Well, that shut him up!
Kled_Original_KillJhin_3.wav|kled|en|Finally, some silence.
Kled_Original_KillKatarina_0.wav|kled|en|I knew he was a liar, 'cause he used them big words.
Kled_Original_KillKatarina_1.wav|kled|en|Let that be a lesson for all them sneaky-sneaks!
Kled_Original_KillKatarina_2.wav|kled|en|Another dead city boy, thinking he could sneaky-sneak on my land.
Kled_Original_KillKatarina_3.wav|kled|en|I've seem some dumb outfits, Skaarl, but a cape made out of knives? Woo, ha! That took the cake!
