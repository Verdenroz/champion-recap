Chaos will follow.
Carnage.
Bask in their blood!
I'll leave them in pieces!
Embrace the jaws of death.
Light meat, dark meat, it's all the same.
No suffering is too great!
You should have done a better job locking me away, Nasus!
You are not my brother, traitor!
Oceans of blood!
Trapped in a box so long Xerath, they never should have let us out!
Xerath, we will give them what they deserve…
All will suffer as I have!
Make this hurt…
Shred their fragile bodies!
They will feel pain they've never imagined!
Massacre them!
There is no retreat.
Chaos will follow.
Who's next on the chopping block?
Welcome the havoc.
Nothing will stop me!
Lavish brutality.
Destruction approaches.
Nasus cannot escape me forever!
The slaughter will never end!
I will spare no one!
I will gut you all!
I will tear the world asunder!
Now you will know agony!
As I live, all will die!
