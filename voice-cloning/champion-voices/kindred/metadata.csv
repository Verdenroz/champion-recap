wavs/audio_0001.wav|You overstep.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Rip them to bits!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Run, if you can!
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Lamb calls!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Go easily.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|This one is yours.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Life is ours...
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Day always turns to...
wavs/audio_0009.wav|A careless step...
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Mine?
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Time to...
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Flee, or stand firm.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|How one dies shows how one lived.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|This will hurt... lots!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Embracing life means accepting death.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|You shine brightly.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Depart in peace.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Hush now. Rest.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Drift gently into oblivion.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|All sparks kindle new flames.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Panic not when life ebbs.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|They break too easy!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|No more words!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Tear out the throat!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Ready to chase? Too bad!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|They struggle! Good!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Feet tire fast!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Will they run?
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Strip away their armor.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Forged in a land unwelcome to us.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|It courses with stolen lives.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I thirst more!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|They shall not ignore us so easily.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|For us, or them?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|A sharper blade makes for a cleaner death.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Sharp enough to slice the veil between life and death.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|They will see two of me!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Another friend.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Cut them deeper!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|They shall only hearmyvoice.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Now!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Mine!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Now!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|We understand your loneliness, but...
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Pop the balloon!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|We know your name, child. Woven across countless almost-lives.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Rushing to meet us again, I see.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Have we met before?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|His song sounds good.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Long have we shadowed your deeds.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Trees make a boring chase!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Chase the cat!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Rengar is well-versed in the ways of the hunter.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Come, Sion, let us end this mockery.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Sometimes, death is a blessing.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|There are no wolves like me!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Words, words, la la la, pew twang pew!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm bored, chase chase chase!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|What happens if you miss?
wavs/audio_0060.wav|The weft and weave of fate guides... um... uh... how did that poem go again?
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Hold still, Wolf.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|The chase ends!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|All things, great and small...
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Return to nothing.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Well hunted, dear Wolf.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|If it draws breath...
wavs/audio_0067.wav|No match for us!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Fun chase!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Never one...
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Have they forgotten us yet, little Lamb?
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Every life...
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Is this what it feels like to end?
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Are you there, dear Wolf?
wavs/audio_0074.wav|How old are we, Lamb?
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Tell me again, little Lamb, which things are mine to take?
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Follow their tracks.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I smell their fear.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|None can hide!
wavs/audio_0079.wav|What sound do they make?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|All things linger...
wavs/audio_0081.wav|They race from us!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|How long will we be together?
wavs/audio_0083.wav|They laugh.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|The weft and weave of fate guides—
wavs/audio_0085.wav|How does hunger feel?
wavs/audio_0086.wav|They know we'll come.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Can't wait for them to flee!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Peacefully, they go.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Those who dread us grant us the most power.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|We are not dreams. We are the waking.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|"""Those who run from death... stood still in life."
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Beauty fades. That is why it is beautiful.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Tomorrow is a hope, never a promise.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|"""There are so many ways to die."
wavs/audio_0095.wav|"""The only true death is to never live."
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Wolf chases what does not willingly go.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Fear makes the chase more fun!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|"""All will know us... in time."
wavs/audio_0099.wav|All who run are mine!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I smell prey!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Hurry, Lamb. Faster.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Bits of them stick in my claws!
wavs/audio_0103.wav|None can hide.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I wonder how they see me.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|No! That was mine!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|How fast can you run?
wavs/audio_0107.wav|We shall remember this theft.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|What folly it is to snatch our marks.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|That was meant to be ours.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|You steal from us...
wavs/audio_0111.wav|An emboldened thief.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|You stole my chase!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|You overstep.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Who's next?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|We take our mark!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|We win!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|What do all stories have in common, dear Wolf?
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Such befalls all who bear our mark.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|That was a good chase!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|All life is temporary.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|No match for me!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Our mark is lifted.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|All your life has led to this moment.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Hahahahaha! That was fun!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|When you see us...
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Treasure your final moments.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Our mark looms over you.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Your time has come.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Fate hunts you today.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Eternal twilight calls for you.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|There you are!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|The hunt begins!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Run! Now!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|The masks of the Kindred seek you!
wavs/audio_0135.wav|We have your name.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|This one is ready!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|We know your name!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Your next treat, dear Wolf.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|I hope this one has strong legs!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|This next one will be easy.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Shall we, dear Wolf?
wavs/audio_0142.wav|A fine life reaches its conclusion.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I will chase it until it's dead!
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Its heart beats fast now!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Their path is destined to cross ours.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Savour life's closing act.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Shine once more, before the end.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Not here, not yet.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Lamb's Respite End SFX
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Lamb's Respite Heal SFX
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Lamb's Respite Buff SFX
wavs/audio_0152.wav|The weft and weave of fate guides—
wavs/audio_0153.wav|I see water!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|It thinks it can beat us!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Choose now:  my arrows...
wavs/audio_0156.wav|I'll give you a running start!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Chasing is the best game in the world... and I always win!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Go, Wolf!
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Now, Wolf!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|My turn!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Never one...
