Your worst decisions will haunt you.
Justice, how boring!
Attacking me with my own blade, sister?
Judge yourself, sister!
True justice needs compassion!
Justice, how boring!
Justice is never blind!
A sword! Cute.
Justice, how boring!
I make my own justice!
Own your frailty!
Feel my pain!
Embrace your pain!
Endure!
Embrace your mistakes!
Do not look away!
Feel your guilt!
Darkness rises!
Revel; you are alive!
Darkness is a gift!
Do not run from your shadow!
Endure this!
Feel!
Suffer!
Darkness reveals truth!
Suffer or feel nothing!
Into the dark!
Share in my torment!
Know me by my pain!
Suffer as I have!
I will show you pain!
Avoid pain, suffer more!
Feel something, anything!
Suffer as I have!
I make my own justice!
Own your frailty!
What's new?
Not even for your twin?
You never do.
Sister. Here to break my heart anew?
Kayle, have you forgotten our father?
Sister. You broke our family and my heart.
Mother must be so proud of all your murders, Kayle.
Ugh, you again.
What have you done with mother's sword?
You mask your feelings, Kayle, because you have none.
Remember strolling together in the woods, when we were girls?
Funny. I remember it differently...
I never did.
At least I haven't smited all my friends.
I need no blade.
Why do we have feet if not to tread upon the soil.
We've never been enemies, sister.
How tragic yours to believe them.
Or large... squirrels?
I am your salvation!
Preach later!
Kayle!
Kayle. Still the same hair after what, a few hundred years?
You hide behind your laws in arrogance, Kayle.
It takes a cold heart to abandon your family.
Do not run from your shadow, Kayle.
Oh, am I pure now, sister?
So this... is how it feels...
Ahh... something new...!
Shielded from yourself.
You thought my magic evil.
Shielded from yourself.
Shielded from yourself.
You're welcome.
Demacian lies are pretty.
Demacian faith is a hollow shield.
Those who wear armor fear death, Garen. And that's a lot of armor.
Those you love can destroy you, Jarvan.
LeBlanc. Wish my twin would disappear as fast as yours.
Your secrets are why you suffer, Lux.
There is darkness in everyone, Lux. Even you.
A metal heart still breaks.
Your soul sings for a fallen world, Sona.
I saw you in your cell, Sylas. Heard your cries. Felt your anguish.
Did someone send you here as a joke, Yordle? Did Kayle send you?
Darkness reveals our truth, Zed.
Let me show you what it is to fall.
Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me not. Loves me!
Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me... not. Ughh.
Time to come down to earth.
Send my regards to mother.
Blood for my blood.
They wanted a villain, I gave them a villain!
Mortality is truly divine.
Pain must be felt.
Take pride in how swiftly we fall.
Kayle, blinded by the shadows your light casts.
I will not disappear, as much as Kayle would like me to.
I am unmade in the image of my twin.
Kayle. I know her soul. She broke my heart.
I shall battle my heartless twin once more.
You demean yourself to fight amongst the mortals, Kayle.
They shall feel my pain, and fear for their souls.
They are not ready for the reflections within my darkness.
Humans are inherently flawed, and yet I trust them more than the divine.
With each step I forge my fate in the fires of pain.
True grace is beautiful in its imperfection, honest in its emotion, freed by its own frailty.
The trials I endured were seared into my soul, they drive me forward even after my wounds have healed.
Wings bound and feet earthly tethered, I move against the false promises of order and justice.
We may fall today, but still we persist.
I move with mortals while she languishes with her lofty ideals
Once I thought the air above was sweet. Now... I find it stifling.
To see the world in black and white is to blind yourself to all of life's colors.
Nothing makes you feel alive like knowing you might die.
I have seen liars choose virtue and I have seen the divine cheat. Perhaps today I will see a Yordle sneeze.
My sister cauterized her wound in holy fire. Mine remains.
I prefer an honest sinner over a righteous liar.
Those who soar amongst the clouds lose sight of the life below.
My broken heart still beats.
My wings are bound, but my soul flies.
I did not fall from grace, I leapt.
Not all light is a gift.
I know what my enemies feel. They are right to be afraid.
I walk so I can feel each fracture of the earth.
Demacia learned all the wrong lessons.
My shadow outruns my sister's light
Truth is a dark mirror.
I find beauty in these shadows.
Some pray to fate. I forge my own path.
Pain is grace.
My wings remember the wind. No longer.
Hmm, battles bring out so many emotions.
Do not conflate darkness with evil.
Righteousness. A splintered shield that I will shatter.
Justice is a lie of the powerful. I have truths of my own.
I would cut off my wings if there were steel strong enough.
We are shaped by our foes.
I chose my shackles.
I was betrayed, once.
Only those you love, can break your heart.
To love is to be bound.
With every step I forge my own fate.
Shadow is not as dark as one might think.
Mistakes shape us.
Betrayal never comes from your enemies.
I shall show them what it is to fall.
Once I had grace, now I have pain.
Only death can break my bonds. And I... am immortal.
You cannot break a shattered soul.
My wings are heavy, but not as heavy as my heart.
We are the sum of our mistakes.
Whether by chains or by wings, we are all bound.
This world is all I have.
My flaws are a badge of honor.
Some call me evil. Shall I prove them right?
I will not forsake the land that shaped me. Nor the mistakes.
Those who judge condemn themselves.
To walk barefoot, skin to soil, is true grace.
Onward through this unchanging land.
I don't hide my pain, I wield it.
Demacia forgot the true cost of war. I remember.
Feel this!
Remain!
Be still!
I told you to remain!
Look What You Made Me Do
I suffered this for you!
I will take on everything!
My pain unbound!
Mortal comforts make immortality bearable.
Home, a place that never leaves you.
I have endured worse.
These mortal cycles begin anew.
I know how it feels to fall. So will you.
Shall I remind you of your vulnerability?
We shall see through their lies.
Darkness is everywhere.
Vision does not require light.
The world is a beautiful place. Do not let it be hidden.
Circled by your sins!
The earth reflects your torment!
I am bound, but I will not break.
