Think what I could offer.
Don't be coy.
One touch is all it takes.
I can predict your every move.
Come, look me in the eyes.
Destroy them from the inside out.
Just a taste.
Good to the last drop.
My affection runs deep.
Die with grace.
Soon it will all sink in.
It seems I must handle things personally.
I do love getting up close and personal.
Running only accelerates the venom.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't forgetmyembrace.
Let me in.
Am I getting under your skin?
Such unrefined creatures.
Poison takes so many forms.
Do not turn your back on me.
We all wear masks. Some better than others.
Let's enjoy our company just a little bit longer.
Sivir! Back to die so soon?
Oh, Sivir, all you ever needed was a sharp prodding.
Apologies, Sivir, I dispose of tools that have exhausted their use.
Nothing escapes my coil.
If you wanna be on top, you have to reach for it.
No legs but I still have a little spring in my step.
Failure is an elegant poison. Let it seep in.
A Noxian always rises to the top.
So many strings waiting to be pulled.
Who will have the 'fortune' of facing me today?
Another game of snake and mice.
Secrets are sharper than blades.
Donottempt a viper.
Many wars begin with a whisper.
Careful, now. I bite.
Like what you see?
Power requires precision.
I'll take care of everything.
Spineless? No. Flexible? Extremely.
Do you have a longing? Would you like one?
I know what everyone wants.
Wealth is valuable only as a means to power.
If you don't control pawns, you are one.
Watch your step.
Think what I could offer.
I'm not so easy to get out of your system.
I like to leave a lasting impression.
Patience, darling.
I may leave, but I'm never gone.
My attentions are needed elsewhere.
I'll be back soon. Miss me.
Sometimes failure just creeps right up on you, doesn't it?
Eventually they all come crawling back.
It's just not possible to sink to the level of this competition.
Keep your eyes open.
Trust what you see.
Watch and wait.
There is no antidote for me.
