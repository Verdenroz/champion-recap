wavs/audio_0001.wav|They're scampering from me?
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Sorry... Sorry!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Shush. It's the dream's turn to sleep.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Dreams die when they're held too tight.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Eeeep! I mean...eep.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|The magic is within you.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|I'm going in! For...some reason.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Ow! Wait, I hit you?
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Close your eyes so I can say hello.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|I knew you could sparkle!
wavs/audio_0011.wav|I know how to use this.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|It won't stop swinging!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Your soul is blooming!
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Hang on, dream!
wavs/audio_0015.wav|All you know is nightmare.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Whoopsie-lily!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Better a sleepy head than a sleepy heart.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Some come to the garden lost. Others, to lose themselves. Like you, Ahri.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Ivern! Am I still your favorite sprout? N-not that I have to be!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|You may have tasted...too much purple.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Neeko, can you teach me why the humans hide what's inside? Or...should I ask your flower?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|You've spread like a shadow no one sees–because it's within themselves!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Nightmares are desire turned inside out, and upside down, and... Oh, dizzy!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Running from problems won't solve them. But it makes me feel safe!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|When he speaks, I hear your whisper, dream!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Why would you want to remove your mask, Yone? It's great for hidin'.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|When trapped in fear, dreams become nightmares. We're fighting the same thing!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|You bring many dreams, sparkly child, but also... much anguish.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Well met! ...Is what I would tell them, if I wasn't already running! Eep!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Do you think we've met before, in a dream we've both forgotten? Wouldn't that be wonderful?!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Th-they see us, dream! Scamper!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Would you...maybe, possibly, perhaps...want to dream with me?
wavs/audio_0033.wav|You, over there! Do you hear me? Not you. Your dream!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Your dream calls to me! I-I hope you don't mind. Oh, you mind, don't you?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Oh hello, bird! What little whisps have you—A-a-a-achoo! Oopsie.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|You dreamed until you ached. Now do something about it.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Sleep well. Dream better.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Dreams live on, even after the dreamer.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|D-don't judge a flower by its bud, you!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Wake up! Wake up.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Humans cast a spell every night. Every time they fall asleep.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|The garden is filled with burls. The burls, with nightmares... Mother Tree, I'll remind them how to dream.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|You can do this, Lillia. You are a strong, capable dream fawn. A-and you have a big stick. A-and you hit people with it but don't really mean it! Sorry.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Where are you, little lost dreams? I'll bring you to your home in the Dreaming Tree.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|I'm glad you're with me, dream.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|In my garden—the garden—there's a tree—the tree.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Night's falling in my garden. Leaves rustle like sheets! Why is...no one dreaming?
wavs/audio_0049.wav|A little girl, lying on her bed. Be brave, dream. She needs you.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Do you think day turns red because it sees night watching, o-or is it just me?
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Dreams are funny things. Sometimes they have feathers, sometimes they are wooly, sometimes they lift me up like a bubble!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Everyone is so loud. They never say what they really mean. Really, really mean.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Humans think trees stand so tall, but they're lying on the air. You can hear them snore, and they're creaking!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I want to meet a human...from over here. C-can they see me? Don't let them see me! I'm not ready! Eep!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Mother Tree used to have so many flowers. I hope you meet her one night, dream.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I can't stop from hiding, from being alone. But maybe, possibly, dream, someone will be alone with me.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Okay! Don't trip, don't trip—oops! Okay! Don't trip again, don't trip again—woah!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Every direction here is straight. Where you leave is always behind you. No wonder the humans are lost.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|My hooves are saying prance, but I-I...oh, too much pressure! Eep!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Dream, I'll tell you a secret. N-never mind. Someone might hear.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|A leaf rustled! Is it okay if I hug my branch? Hug...
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Don't see me, don't see me, don't see me, don't see me! See me.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Oh, Mr. Root, you almost tripped me.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|When they say goodnight, do you think they mean it?
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Every time I hold my branch, I see the tree with my fingers.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I'll stay in the forest...until I learn how to use doors.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|A curly mind twists towards possibilities!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|I'll just...look around for threats. Fifth time's the charm!
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I'll face anything...b-but won't look it in the eyes. Eep!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|A yawn is a smile before sleep.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Day dreams, night dreams, mid-morning dreams, dusk dreams!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|The beauty of the world beckons desires to be real.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Time to out-trot my awkwardness!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|How can I tip-toe, when I don't have toes?!
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Dreams help more than gardens grow.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|When I'm quiet, I hear so many things.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Quiet things are strong. That's why I'm whispering!
wavs/audio_0078.wav|The humans forget so much when they awake.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|You'll be safe with me, dream.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|I like talking to you, dream.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Every human has a little sparkle.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Nothing cries louder than loneliness.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Hold my branch with me, dream.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|What lies beneath the surface? We lie it down to see.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I catch dreams so the humans can chase them.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|You have to close your eyes to open them. Wh-whoops!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Eep.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|I just had the strangest reality.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Oh!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|No one saw that, no one saw that!
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Well met, human. Well left, dreams.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Was...was that...me?!
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I'm just going to go hide forever now.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Everything's so beautiful when it's real!
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Look who's blooming now!
wavs/audio_0096.wav|One hoof tra, two hooves tra-la!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Let's dance above the human snores! Hehehe!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Our world is so alive!
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Our joy will plant a smile seed!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Every flower blooms to be seen!
wavs/audio_0101.wav|So much to live, so much to love!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Dreams! Have you come out to play?
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Don't be shy, Lillia. Be Lillia!
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Bloom with me.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Who can dream how a dream is born?
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I'm prancing. I'm singing. I'm prance-singing!
wavs/audio_0107.wav|It's like my roots are in the clouds!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|There was never anything to fear...!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|I and me are having a party, dream.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I was sparkling the whole time, and no one told me?!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Let's find ourselves in our dreams!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Whoopsie!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Whoopsie!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Sleepy time!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Sleeeepy time!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Oh! Are you alright, dream? Your light is so dim...
wavs/audio_0118.wav|What's wrong, dream? Are you ready to bloom? Oh!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Not good. Not good!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Do you think they'll remember me, dream? When they wake up, do they remember themselves?
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Now I just have to wait for my confidence to regrow.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Fall awake. Rise asleep.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I'm not wearing any pants! Oh...oh. So that's what human nightmares are like.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Ill met.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Time to be 'mean Lillia'! ...Did it work?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Me? A dream come true.
