Weak.
I could learn to trust someone like you.
Didn't expect the assist. Thanks.
Alright, I'll admit you helped.
You're dependable. I like that.
You'll watch my back? Just like that? Cool.
Don't get comfortable. I work alone.
Guess we're doing this!
You can't fix what I break!
This'll shut you up.
This is who I am now!
Oh, we're fighting!
Don't say I didn't warn you!
Say goodbye to your teeth!
Hey, idiot!
I'll bust you down to scrap!
You! You're in my way!
Alright. Die then.
Now I'm mad!
This is for everyone I've lost!
I will kill you!
They'll find you in pieces.
You're nothing.
Out of my way!
Step up then!
You're too soft for this!
You got a problem?!
Hope you brought an army!
Sit down!
I don't move for anyone!
Dumbest fight you've ever picked.
Do! Not! Push me!
This is gonna suck for you!
I told you to stay back!
I'm pissed!
Here comes an ass kicking!
I can't stop fighting...
Get mean!
Toughen up!
Don't die!
I got you!
We fight together!
Hey, snake. I'm gonna crush your bones.
You know my dad, General. So you know what's about to happen.
O...Oh. So your name's Ekko? That's... that's cool. I'm cool.
Bet the rose would sure hate losing their pet bug.
You know I can see you, right? Gross little gerbil man...
Hey, LeBlanc! Tell my mom I'm gonna rip her head off!
All right, Rell. Be cool. It's just a tall, super-strong armored lady.
You're Mordekaiser, right? All metal. I can take you.
Samira. If you're looking for me, here I am.
You're cute, Seraphine. Uh, well, bye.
More like the boss of having his shirt off. Oh, I think he heard that.
Noxus will fall, Swain. Starting with you!
Boo, you suck.
I'm the happiest girl in the world...
Wheeeeeeee.
One dead snake, one less petal on the rose.
You shoulda kept better tabs on your people, General.
Ugh. Just when I thought I knew him, he went back in time.
One evil spider lady down, several evil animal people to go.
Your lizard had the right idea. 'General-Admiral-Brigadier' Kled.
Good. That'll send mom the message.
I hope this won't hurt my chances, Leona. Leona?
Noxus was afraid of that guy? This might be easier than I thought.
No one beats me, no one breaks me, and no one stand in my way!'
So long, Samira. Thought you'd be more stylish than that.
We would not be good together, Sera.
Does this mean I'm your boss now? I gotta walk away, this is too much.
Hmph. 'Grand General.'
Beaten by a girl, to death.
Let's try that again. Hi, I'm Rell.
Someone scrape this idiot off the floor.
Thanks for the practice, stupid.
Onto the next.
I told you not to fight me, but here we are.
I've kicked rocks tougher than you.
Fight like you mean it. Die for something that matters!
This 'little girl' is about to crush some heads.
Run 'em all down! We're good, they're bad, and that's all you need to know.
They'll pay for what happened to me. Noxus, The Black Rose... everyone.
The people who hurt me are dead. All but one. My mother.
The Rose ripped the magic out of my friends and put it into me. I hate them.
Those academy kids are still out there. I'll find them all. I'll save them.
When steel crashes against steel, it's so loud. I almost forget.
Memories suck.
If I trusted people, I'd need even more armor.
I survived the academy. My 'instructors'... didn't.
Noxians aren't the heroes they think they are.
I'd rather break rules than people, but I can make exceptions.
Bones shatter and people lie, but I can always count on iron.
The helpless fight. The hardened live.
They call it ferromancy. Metal magic.
Forgiveness? Never.
Trust is a luxury no one can afford.
Forge your heart into something strong, unbreakable.
The Rose wanted me to be a weapon. Well, here I am.
I'll twist Noxus until it snaps.
Friends just get in the way.
Hurt me enough and I'll split your head open.
I fight for the lost. But mostly, I just fight.
I'll finish this fight. I'm the only one who can.
These sigils are a reminder. Screw my sigils.
Everyone who's ever stood in my way is dead or broken.
Don't let anyone in. Never let anyone in.
The Black Rose may have done this to me, but Noxus knew.
The armor keeps the world out. The lance does the rest.
Nobody leaves!
Do not walk away!
I am not finished!
All this waiting! I just want to fight!
This sucks! I don't have time for this!
Come on! I hate waiting!
Can't tell if I taste metal or blood.
'Excellence is measured in sacrifice,' or whatever.
How 'bout you say that again?!
Iron body, iron will!
I refuse to be broken!
I'll fight to the end!
Let's do this for real!
For the null!
Armoring up!
Unbreakable!
Run 'em down!
Ride!
Don't fall behind!
Mount up!
Let's crush 'em underhoof!
Nothing gets in, no one gets out.
