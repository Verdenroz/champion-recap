Been to the bottom of the sea. Gets a little deeper each time.
We're already on the menu, all we gotta do is crawl in the pot… Boil.
Went too deep. Part of me is still down there… swimming.
Every kill makes the voices louder… and I looove what they're screaming.
I've killed a lot of monsters. None of them lived in the sea.

Lure 'em in.
Light in the murk.
Got myeyeon you.
I got no blind spots.
Misty out there…
Fog's rolling in.
Getting murky…

Out of the murk!
Coming up!
Breach!
