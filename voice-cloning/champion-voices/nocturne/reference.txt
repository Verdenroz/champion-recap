Afraid of the dark?
Their twilight approaches.
Hyperion Cantos
Hyperion Cantos
The light is fading.
Drip-drop, the sound of blood.
Help is not coming...
This place disgusts me.
People are flames to be blotted out.
Are you getting tired yet?
Swim in terror!
I sense fear.
Do I scare you, summoner?
Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?
Hyperion Cantos
Darkness...
Darkness...
Darkness...
All alone...
Bring me more flesh bags to slice up!
Hyperion Cantos
