wavs/audio_0001.wav|Think what I could offer.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Don't be coy.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|One touch is all it takes.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I can predict your every move.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Come, look me in the eyes.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Destroy them from the inside out.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Just a taste.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Good to the last drop.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|My affection runs deep.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Die with grace.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Soon it will all sink in.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|It seems I must handle things personally.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I do love getting up close and personal.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Running only accelerates the venom.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|You won't feel a thing.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|You won't forgetmyembrace.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Let me in.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Am I getting under your skin?
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Such unrefined creatures.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Poison takes so many forms.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Do not turn your back on me.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|We all wear masks. Some better than others.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Let's enjoy our company just a little bit longer.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Sivir! Back to die so soon?
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Oh, Sivir, all you ever needed was a sharp prodding.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Apologies, Sivir, I dispose of tools that have exhausted their use.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Nothing escapes my coil.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|If you wanna be on top, you have to reach for it.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|No legs but I still have a little spring in my step.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Failure is an elegant poison. Let it seep in.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|A Noxian always rises to the top.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|So many strings waiting to be pulled.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Who will have the 'fortune' of facing me today?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Another game of snake and mice.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Secrets are sharper than blades.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Donottempt a viper.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Many wars begin with a whisper.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Careful, now. I bite.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Like what you see?
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Power requires precision.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I'll take care of everything.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Spineless? No. Flexible? Extremely.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Do you have a longing? Would you like one?
wavs/audio_0044.wav|I know what everyone wants.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Wealth is valuable only as a means to power.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|If you don't control pawns, you are one.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Watch your step.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Think what I could offer.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|I'm not so easy to get out of your system.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|I like to leave a lasting impression.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Patience, darling.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I may leave, but I'm never gone.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|My attentions are needed elsewhere.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I'll be back soon. Miss me.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Sometimes failure just creeps right up on you, doesn't it?
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Eventually they all come crawling back.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|It's just not possible to sink to the level of this competition.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Keep your eyes open.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Trust what you see.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Watch and wait.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|There is no antidote for me.
