wavs/audio_0001.wav|You wouldn't last a day in the Void.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Back in your hole!
wavs/audio_0003.wav|You don't belong here.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|You talk too much.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Settle down, sister.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|You want crazy?
wavs/audio_0008.wav|You seem familiar.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Have we met?
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Something is off here.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Don't test me.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|I know your tricks.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You will leave this place.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Not onmywatch, glutton.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Vilecreature…
wavs/audio_0016.wav|What are you…?
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Looking for me?
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Let's set the story straight.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Step back, 'Red'.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|You're outgunned.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|You call those guns?
wavs/audio_0022.wav|This, is not the Void!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Come on!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|You will die here, creature!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Not today.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|This ismyhome, Void-spawn!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|You must be lost, creature.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|I am not afraid anymore.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|This ismyhome, Void-spawn.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Go back, 'Voidling'!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Die, trespasser.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|My suit hungers.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|I kill so they don't die!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Thick skin always wins!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|This is why I survived.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|The hunt is on.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|I wield the abyss!
wavs/audio_0038.wav|This is why I came back!
wavs/audio_0039.wav|You'rethe hunted!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|I won't quit!
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Just the beginning.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Let's see what you're made of!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|You're nothing!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Just for you!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Kai'Sa, remember the name.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Come on… come on…
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Come on! Let's go.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Fear me!
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Strike hard!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|One mistake is all it takes.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|I'm back.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Found your weakness.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Power, not hate.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|I amnotafraid.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Fear the Void's sting!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Myturn!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You'rethe prey!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Foolish quarry!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|I'll be your monster!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Iwon'tback down!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I'm right here!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Hit 'n' move!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Kai'Sa screams.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Kai'Sa grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Kai'Sa grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Huh? *gasps, then grunts* …huh?
wavs/audio_0077.wav|That's one.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Two down.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|That's three.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|And four.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|That's five.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Yes! Six.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Seven.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Eight kills.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|Nine lives taken.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Ten down.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Eleven.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|That's a dozen for me.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Thirteen—unlucky for them.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Fourteen.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Fifteen, and counting.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Sixteen.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|And, seventeen. Wow.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Eighteen.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Uh-huh… Nineteen.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Twenty! Yeaaah!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Twenty-one!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Twenty-two! …That's a lot.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Twenty-three.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Twenty-four… …I can't even.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Twenty-five! Come at me!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I'm done counting.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|You're now dead, prophet; that is the truth that will be told.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|I forgive you, Malzahar… but I do not forget.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Goodbye, Malzahar, nowIwill tell this tale.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|For you! For us.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|This is why they need me.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Will they now see? I can do this!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Yes! We did it.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|That sent a message.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|That's just the start.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Coward!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Almostmade it!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|The Void's reach is long.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|I'll take that.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|You can't outrun the Void.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|OnlyIcan escape the Void.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|They weresoclose!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Too late to run!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Kai'Sa laughs.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|The first wave is upon us.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|These creatures seek the living… even here.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|"""That smell… unmistakable. The Void."
wavs/audio_0124.wav|The Void has breached this place.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Father?
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Reunions can be so bittersweet.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Could it-… be true?
wavs/audio_0128.wav|It smells like home here…
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Huh… Memories of my father come at the strangest moments.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|My appearance may frighten you, but make no mistake: I am on your side, and we fight to the bitter end.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|This suit lives on me. It calls me home. We survive together…
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Stay with me, and we live.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|When memories fade and darkness surrounds you… find the strength inside.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|You know that feeling, when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? …That's just an itch, compared to what lives on me.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Here is where we make our stand. Do as I say. It's the only way, if we want to live.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|The first time I returned from theVoid… It was to saveme… Now, it's to savethem.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|…A cool breeze. I remember these. Reminds me of home.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void…
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I survived the Void—buthereis where my story has its best ending.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|My skin is crawling… the needles… the itch… Time to hunt.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Theyneedto listen to me. Then, they would see that I can show them a better way.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Love… fear… whatever it's called—it's survival that motivates everyone.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I can rid them of these monsters… but who will save them from themselves?
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Downthere, I was surrounded by nothingness… but I was never alone. Memories comfort like the closest companion.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|The skin grows restless… It needs to feed. If it doesn't… could I be next?
wavs/audio_0150.wav|When I was a child, I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now, I call it home.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Fight hard. You are a living weapon.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Let go of the anger. It does not serve.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. Irefuseto accept it as my fate.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|…Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa; and you will have a chance…
wavs/audio_0156.wav|The Void consumes everything; leaving only emptiness in its wake.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|The hunting ground has changed… but the hunt is the same.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Danger is real—fear is an illusion.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell, would they see I'm just like them…
wavs/audio_0160.wav|The Void willnotconsume me; but I must act, or the others will not be as lucky.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Only a child… and no one came to save me.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Iam the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Maybe someday they will come to accept me. Fornow, they will need me.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Anger is useless to me—a wound that will only continue to fester.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|I came for the hunt… but I'll stay for the fruit.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Exploit their weakness.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|Survival means never stopping—the Void knows that too.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|I return stronger than I left.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Get up. Stand firm. Strike hard.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I can make a difference here.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Monsters are everywhere.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|I like it here, I just might stay.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|This skin lives on me, and hunts with me.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|Void rule number one: don't die.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Iwillmake a difference here.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|It's a good day for a hunt.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Exploit their mistakes.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|This world is changing… We decide into what.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|This place is beautiful… I'm going to save it.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Thisis my purpose, learn from me.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Forgiveness is hard… but so very worth it.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Survival is an instinct we all have.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Feed the beast… or be its meal.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|It's fight or flight, onlynowI do not run.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Are those peaches I smell?
wavs/audio_0188.wav|I was spared for a reason.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Hold our ground; attack them in theirs.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Stay alert, stay aggressive.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|I came back for the others who could not.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Ah, trees… How I missed them.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|A moving target lives longer.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|This suit hunts in the mannerIchoose.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|They're hiding.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Don't be fooled.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|It's a trap—be ready.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Kai'Sa shouts in effort.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Kai'Sa shouts in effort.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Kai'Sa shouts in effort.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Kai'Sa shouts in effort.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Kai'Sa gasps deeply.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Kai'Sa grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Kai'Sa grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Kai'Sa gasps deeply.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Kai'Sa shouts.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Kai'Sa shouts.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Kai'Sa shouts.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Kai'Sa shouts.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|Don't be long; we're stronger together.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Don't worry, I will fight alone. I've done it before.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|I'll stand our ground while you're away.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|That's enough for the moment. The hunt will resume.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|I'll be back for more.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|I need to gather my strength.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|Ohh, how I missed these!
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Mmm!
wavs/audio_0222.wav|What a pleasant surprise!
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the… honeyfruit?!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the fruit!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Not peaches… but, they'll do.
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Thanks for that.
wavs/audio_0227.wav|I'll take it!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|That isjustwhat I needed!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Ah, that works.
wavs/audio_0230.wav|I won't forget this.
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Ahh, that's much better.
wavs/audio_0232.wav|I needed that.
wavs/audio_0233.wav|All better now.
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Alright!
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Yes! Teamwork.
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Nice reflexes!
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Whew.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|We're stronger together.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Nice work!
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Thanks.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Whoa! Nice!
wavs/audio_0242.wav|You, are awesome.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Whew, that was close.
wavs/audio_0244.wav|Thanks.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|In the Void, I had no one; I was a doomed outsider. Here, people are everywhere—and they are all mine.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|The Void-spawn offer athousandways to die, andoneway to live: become like them.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|I grew up deep inside a vast emptiness—I do not wish to grow old in one.Thatis why we must fight.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|"""The Void is not so much a place—it is a power, reaching out to consume all life."
wavs/audio_0249.wav|The things we carry should lift us up, not weigh us down. Memories, love, and hope… are the lightest necessities.
wavs/audio_0250.wav|The yoke of fear is a heavy burden. Hunters must be nimble, and walk lightly.
wavs/audio_0251.wav|Some call me 'monster'. They have no idea what lurks just below us all.
wavs/audio_0252.wav|Kai'Sa snarls.
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Kai'Sa snarls.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Kai'Sa snarls.
wavs/audio_0255.wav|I've been to the Void and back. You're nothing.
wavs/audio_0256.wav|Vision can make all the difference.
wavs/audio_0257.wav|Theywillcome. We'll be ready.
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Letthemcome to us.
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0260.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0263.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Kai'Sa gasps deeply.
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0266.wav|Kai'Sa gasps deeply.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|They can run, but they can't hide.
wavs/audio_0268.wav|Mm-hmm.
wavs/audio_0269.wav|I am good.
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Got one!
wavs/audio_0271.wav|Yes.
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Marked by the Void.
wavs/audio_0273.wav|I see you.
wavs/audio_0274.wav|Prey marked.
wavs/audio_0275.wav|Perfect.
wavs/audio_0276.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0277.wav|Too slow.
wavs/audio_0278.wav|That was easy.
wavs/audio_0279.wav|Tag.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|You're all mine.
wavs/audio_0281.wav|They can't get away.
wavs/audio_0282.wav|Walked into that one.
wavs/audio_0283.wav|I knew it.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|Prepare for what's next.
wavs/audio_0285.wav|They'll think twice next time.
wavs/audio_0286.wav|Yes!
wavs/audio_0287.wav|That'll leave a mark.
wavs/audio_0288.wav|They never saw it coming.
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Revealed.
wavs/audio_0290.wav|Running, is only half a plan.
wavs/audio_0291.wav|Nice!
wavs/audio_0292.wav|Found you.
wavs/audio_0293.wav|Dammit! Dammit!!
wavs/audio_0294.wav|That was pointless.
wavs/audio_0295.wav|Do better next time, Kai'Sa…
wavs/audio_0296.wav|'Close' doesn't count.
wavs/audio_0297.wav|Agh…
wavs/audio_0298.wav|Dammit. Take your time, Kai'Sa!
wavs/audio_0299.wav|Ugh, clumsy girl…!
wavs/audio_0300.wav|They got lucky.
wavs/audio_0301.wav|You don't belong here.
wavs/audio_0302.wav|Back in your hole!
wavs/audio_0303.wav|A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax.
wavs/audio_0304.wav|I guess I'm next, Jax.
wavs/audio_0305.wav|You talk too much.
wavs/audio_0306.wav|You want crazy?
wavs/audio_0307.wav|Settle down, sister.
wavs/audio_0308.wav|You seem familiar.
wavs/audio_0309.wav|Have we met?
wavs/audio_0310.wav|Something is off here.
wavs/audio_0311.wav|I know your tricks.
wavs/audio_0312.wav|Don't test me.
wavs/audio_0313.wav|You will leave this place.
wavs/audio_0314.wav|Vilecreature…
wavs/audio_0315.wav|What are you…?
wavs/audio_0316.wav|Not onmywatch, glutton.
wavs/audio_0317.wav|Looking for me?
wavs/audio_0318.wav|Let's set the story straight.
wavs/audio_0319.wav|You're outgunned.
wavs/audio_0320.wav|You call those guns?
wavs/audio_0321.wav|Step back, 'Red'.
wavs/audio_0322.wav|This ismyhome, Void-spawn!
wavs/audio_0323.wav|Come on!
wavs/audio_0324.wav|This, is not the Void!
wavs/audio_0325.wav|Not today.
wavs/audio_0326.wav|You will die here, creature!
wavs/audio_0327.wav|I am not afraid anymore.
wavs/audio_0328.wav|Die, trespasser.
wavs/audio_0329.wav|This ismyhome, Void-spawn.
wavs/audio_0330.wav|Go back, 'Voidling'!
wavs/audio_0331.wav|You must be lost, creature.
wavs/audio_0332.wav|Found your weakness.
wavs/audio_0333.wav|Just the beginning.
wavs/audio_0334.wav|One mistake is all it takes.
wavs/audio_0335.wav|Just for you!
wavs/audio_0336.wav|I won't quit!
wavs/audio_0337.wav|I'm right here!
wavs/audio_0338.wav|Hit 'n' move!
wavs/audio_0339.wav|The hunt is on.
wavs/audio_0340.wav|Thick skin always wins!
wavs/audio_0341.wav|Iwon'tback down!
wavs/audio_0342.wav|You're nothing!
wavs/audio_0343.wav|Foolish quarry!
wavs/audio_0344.wav|Power, not hate.
wavs/audio_0345.wav|I kill so they don't die!
wavs/audio_0346.wav|I'm back.
wavs/audio_0347.wav|Strike hard!
wavs/audio_0348.wav|Fear me!
wavs/audio_0349.wav|My suit hungers.
wavs/audio_0350.wav|I amnotafraid.
wavs/audio_0351.wav|Come on! Let's go.
wavs/audio_0352.wav|This is why I came back!
wavs/audio_0353.wav|Kai'Sa, remember the name.
wavs/audio_0354.wav|Let's see what you're made of!
wavs/audio_0355.wav|Come on… come on…
wavs/audio_0356.wav|Fear the Void's sting!
wavs/audio_0357.wav|You'rethe hunted!
wavs/audio_0358.wav|I wield the abyss!
wavs/audio_0359.wav|Myturn!
wavs/audio_0360.wav|I'll be your monster!
wavs/audio_0361.wav|You'rethe prey!
wavs/audio_0362.wav|This is why I survived.
wavs/audio_0363.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0364.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0365.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0366.wav|Kai'Sa huffs.
wavs/audio_0367.wav|Kai'Sa screams.
wavs/audio_0368.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0369.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.
wavs/audio_0370.wav|Kai'Sa hyperventilates.

wavs/audio_0374.wav|Kai'Sa grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0375.wav|Kai'Sa grunts in great effort.
wavs/audio_0376.wav|Huh? *gasps, then grunts* …huh?
wavs/audio_0377.wav|That's one.
wavs/audio_0378.wav|Two down.
wavs/audio_0379.wav|That's three.
wavs/audio_0380.wav|And four.
wavs/audio_0381.wav|That's five.
wavs/audio_0382.wav|Yes! Six.
wavs/audio_0383.wav|Seven.
wavs/audio_0384.wav|Eight kills.
wavs/audio_0385.wav|Nine lives taken.
wavs/audio_0386.wav|Ten down.
wavs/audio_0387.wav|Eleven.
wavs/audio_0388.wav|That's a dozen for me.
wavs/audio_0389.wav|Thirteen—unlucky for them.
wavs/audio_0390.wav|Fourteen.
wavs/audio_0391.wav|Fifteen, and counting.
wavs/audio_0392.wav|Sixteen.
wavs/audio_0393.wav|And, seventeen. Wow.
wavs/audio_0394.wav|Eighteen.
wavs/audio_0395.wav|Uh-huh… Nineteen.
wavs/audio_0396.wav|Twenty! Yeaaah!
wavs/audio_0397.wav|Twenty-one!
wavs/audio_0398.wav|Twenty-two! …That's a lot.
wavs/audio_0399.wav|Twenty-three.
wavs/audio_0400.wav|Twenty-four… …I can't even.
wavs/audio_0401.wav|Twenty-five! Come at me!
wavs/audio_0402.wav|I'm done counting.
wavs/audio_0403.wav|Goodbye, Malzahar, nowIwill tell this tale.
wavs/audio_0404.wav|I forgive you, Malzahar… but I do not forget.
wavs/audio_0405.wav|You're now dead, prophet; that is the truth that will be told.
wavs/audio_0406.wav|For you! For us.
wavs/audio_0407.wav|Will they now see? I can do this!
wavs/audio_0408.wav|This is why they need me.
wavs/audio_0409.wav|That sent a message.
wavs/audio_0410.wav|That's just the start.
wavs/audio_0411.wav|Yes! We did it.
wavs/audio_0412.wav|Too late to run!
wavs/audio_0413.wav|You can't outrun the Void.
wavs/audio_0414.wav|The Void's reach is long.
wavs/audio_0415.wav|I'll take that.
wavs/audio_0416.wav|OnlyIcan escape the Void.
wavs/audio_0417.wav|Almostmade it!
wavs/audio_0418.wav|Coward!
wavs/audio_0419.wav|They weresoclose!
wavs/audio_0420.wav|Kai'Sa laughs.
wavs/audio_0421.wav|The Void has breached this place.
wavs/audio_0422.wav|These creatures seek the living… even here.
wavs/audio_0423.wav|"""That smell… unmistakable. The Void."
wavs/audio_0424.wav|The first wave is upon us.
wavs/audio_0425.wav|Father?
wavs/audio_0426.wav|It smells like home here…
wavs/audio_0427.wav|Huh… Memories of my father come at the strangest moments.
wavs/audio_0428.wav|Reunions can be so bittersweet.
wavs/audio_0429.wav|Could it-… be true?
wavs/audio_0430.wav|The first time I returned from theVoid… It was to saveme… Now, it's to savethem.
wavs/audio_0431.wav|Here is where we make our stand. Do as I say. It's the only way, if we want to live.
wavs/audio_0432.wav|When memories fade and darkness surrounds you… find the strength inside.
wavs/audio_0433.wav|This suit lives on me. It calls me home. We survive together…
wavs/audio_0434.wav|Stay with me, and we live.
wavs/audio_0435.wav|You know that feeling, when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? …That's just an itch, compared to what lives on me.
wavs/audio_0436.wav|My appearance may frighten you, but make no mistake: I am on your side, and we fight to the bitter end.
wavs/audio_0437.wav|Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell, would they see I'm just like them…
wavs/audio_0438.wav|Love… fear… whatever it's called—it's survival that motivates everyone.
wavs/audio_0439.wav|Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble.
wavs/audio_0440.wav|Maybe someday they will come to accept me. Fornow, they will need me.
wavs/audio_0441.wav|…A cool breeze. I remember these. Reminds me of home.
wavs/audio_0442.wav|Fight hard. You are a living weapon.
wavs/audio_0443.wav|I survived the Void—buthereis where my story has its best ending.
wavs/audio_0444.wav|When I was a child, I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now, I call it home.
wavs/audio_0445.wav|Theyneedto listen to me. Then, they would see that I can show them a better way.
wavs/audio_0446.wav|Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there.
wavs/audio_0447.wav|The hunting ground has changed… but the hunt is the same.
wavs/audio_0448.wav|This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live.
wavs/audio_0449.wav|The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it.
wavs/audio_0450.wav|This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void…
wavs/audio_0451.wav|I can rid them of these monsters… but who will save them from themselves?
wavs/audio_0452.wav|Only a child… and no one came to save me.
wavs/audio_0453.wav|The skin grows restless… It needs to feed. If it doesn't… could I be next?
wavs/audio_0454.wav|Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it.
wavs/audio_0455.wav|Iam the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all.
wavs/audio_0456.wav|Anger is useless to me—a wound that will only continue to fester.
wavs/audio_0457.wav|Downthere, I was surrounded by nothingness… but I was never alone. Memories comfort like the closest companion.
wavs/audio_0458.wav|Danger is real—fear is an illusion.
wavs/audio_0459.wav|…Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa; and you will have a chance…
wavs/audio_0460.wav|Let go of the anger. It does not serve.
wavs/audio_0461.wav|The Void willnotconsume me; but I must act, or the others will not be as lucky.
wavs/audio_0462.wav|I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. Irefuseto accept it as my fate.
wavs/audio_0463.wav|This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted.
wavs/audio_0464.wav|My skin is crawling… the needles… the itch… Time to hunt.
wavs/audio_0465.wav|The Void consumes everything; leaving only emptiness in its wake.
wavs/audio_0466.wav|Thisis my purpose, learn from me.
wavs/audio_0467.wav|Feed the beast… or be its meal.
wavs/audio_0468.wav|This place is beautiful… I'm going to save it.
wavs/audio_0469.wav|Stay alert, stay aggressive.
wavs/audio_0470.wav|Ah, trees… How I missed them.
wavs/audio_0471.wav|Hold our ground; attack them in theirs.
wavs/audio_0472.wav|It's a good day for a hunt.
wavs/audio_0473.wav|This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct.
wavs/audio_0474.wav|Exploit their mistakes.
wavs/audio_0475.wav|This skin lives on me, and hunts with me.
wavs/audio_0476.wav|Iwillmake a difference here.
wavs/audio_0477.wav|Survival is an instinct we all have.
wavs/audio_0478.wav|I can make a difference here.
wavs/audio_0479.wav|It's fight or flight, onlynowI do not run.
wavs/audio_0480.wav|I was spared for a reason.
wavs/audio_0481.wav|Monsters are everywhere.
wavs/audio_0482.wav|Exploit their weakness.
wavs/audio_0483.wav|Get up. Stand firm. Strike hard.
wavs/audio_0484.wav|I like it here, I just might stay.
wavs/audio_0485.wav|Forgiveness is hard… but so very worth it.
wavs/audio_0486.wav|This suit hunts in the mannerIchoose.
wavs/audio_0487.wav|Are those peaches I smell?
wavs/audio_0488.wav|I return stronger than I left.
wavs/audio_0489.wav|I came back for the others who could not.
wavs/audio_0490.wav|Survival means never stopping—the Void knows that too.
wavs/audio_0491.wav|Void rule number one: don't die.
wavs/audio_0492.wav|I came for the hunt… but I'll stay for the fruit.
wavs/audio_0493.wav|A moving target lives longer.
wavs/audio_0494.wav|This world is changing… We decide into what.
wavs/audio_0495.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0496.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0497.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0498.wav|Kai'Sa huffs and releases.
wavs/audio_0499.wav|Don't be fooled.
wavs/audio_0500.wav|It's a trap—be ready.
wavs/audio_0501.wav|They're hiding.
wavs/audio_0502.wav|Kai'Sa shouts in effort.
wavs/audio_0503.wav|Kai'Sa shouts in effort.

wavs/audio_0512.wav|Kai'Sa shouts.
wavs/audio_0513.wav|Kai'Sa shouts.
wavs/audio_0514.wav|Don't worry, I will fight alone. I've done it before.
wavs/audio_0515.wav|I'll stand our ground while you're away.
wavs/audio_0516.wav|Don't be long; we're stronger together.
wavs/audio_0517.wav|That's enough for the moment. The hunt will resume.
wavs/audio_0518.wav|I need to gather my strength.
wavs/audio_0519.wav|I'll be back for more.
wavs/audio_0520.wav|Not peaches… but, they'll do.
wavs/audio_0521.wav|What a pleasant surprise!
wavs/audio_0522.wav|Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the… honeyfruit?!
wavs/audio_0523.wav|Mmm!
wavs/audio_0524.wav|Ohh, how I missed these!
wavs/audio_0525.wav|Sometimes, you have to stop and taste the fruit!
wavs/audio_0526.wav|Thanks for that.
wavs/audio_0527.wav|I won't forget this.
wavs/audio_0528.wav|Ahh, that's much better.
wavs/audio_0529.wav|I needed that.
wavs/audio_0530.wav|I'll take it!
wavs/audio_0531.wav|That isjustwhat I needed!
wavs/audio_0532.wav|All better now.
wavs/audio_0533.wav|Ah, that works.
wavs/audio_0534.wav|Whoa! Nice!
wavs/audio_0535.wav|Yes! Teamwork.
wavs/audio_0536.wav|Nice reflexes!
wavs/audio_0537.wav|Alright!
wavs/audio_0538.wav|You, are awesome.
wavs/audio_0539.wav|Whew, that was close.
wavs/audio_0540.wav|Thanks.
wavs/audio_0541.wav|We're stronger together.
wavs/audio_0542.wav|Whew.
wavs/audio_0543.wav|Nice work!
wavs/audio_0544.wav|Thanks.
wavs/audio_0545.wav|The Void-spawn offer athousandways to die, andoneway to live: become like them.
wavs/audio_0546.wav|"""The Void is not so much a place—it is a power, reaching out to consume all life."
wavs/audio_0547.wav|Some call me 'monster'. They have no idea what lurks just below us all.
wavs/audio_0548.wav|I grew up deep inside a vast emptiness—I do not wish to grow old in one.Thatis why we must fight.
wavs/audio_0549.wav|The yoke of fear is a heavy burden. Hunters must be nimble, and walk lightly.
wavs/audio_0550.wav|The things we carry should lift us up, not weigh us down. Memories, love, and hope… are the lightest necessities.
wavs/audio_0551.wav|In the Void, I had no one; I was a doomed outsider. Here, people are everywhere—and they are all mine.
wavs/audio_0552.wav|Kai'Sa snarls.
wavs/audio_0553.wav|Kai'Sa snarls.
wavs/audio_0554.wav|Kai'Sa snarls.
wavs/audio_0555.wav|I've been to the Void and back. You're nothing.
wavs/audio_0556.wav|Letthemcome to us.
wavs/audio_0557.wav|Theywillcome. We'll be ready.

wavs/audio_0569.wav|You're all mine.
wavs/audio_0570.wav|Mm-hmm.
wavs/audio_0571.wav|Got one!
wavs/audio_0572.wav|Too slow.
wavs/audio_0573.wav|That was easy.
wavs/audio_0574.wav|Prey marked.
wavs/audio_0575.wav|I am good.
wavs/audio_0576.wav|Revealed.
wavs/audio_0577.wav|They never saw it coming.
wavs/audio_0578.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0579.wav|That'll leave a mark.
wavs/audio_0580.wav|I see you.
wavs/audio_0581.wav|They can't get away.
wavs/audio_0582.wav|Walked into that one.
wavs/audio_0583.wav|I knew it.
wavs/audio_0584.wav|Prepare for what's next.
wavs/audio_0585.wav|They'll think twice next time.
wavs/audio_0586.wav|Nice!
wavs/audio_0587.wav|Running, is only half a plan.
wavs/audio_0588.wav|Yes.
wavs/audio_0589.wav|They can run, but they can't hide.
wavs/audio_0590.wav|Marked by the Void.
wavs/audio_0591.wav|Found you.
wavs/audio_0592.wav|Perfect.
wavs/audio_0593.wav|'Close' doesn't count.
wavs/audio_0594.wav|Agh…
wavs/audio_0595.wav|That was pointless.
wavs/audio_0596.wav|Do better next time, Kai'Sa…
wavs/audio_0597.wav|Dammit. Take your time, Kai'Sa!
wavs/audio_0598.wav|Ugh, clumsy girl…!
wavs/audio_0599.wav|Dammit! Dammit!!
wavs/audio_0600.wav|They got lucky.
wavs/audio_0601.wav|Are you the hunter…or the prey?
