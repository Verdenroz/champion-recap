They cannot handle Neeko.
YOU are in TROUBLE!
No more mister nice Neeko.
I will blast their sho'ma in the face!
Your ancestors will feel this.
You messed with the wrong Neeko!
Who strong Neeko now?
Too late to play nice.
No one underestimate Neeko!
Bagaduhng!
Neeko cast magic on you. Shoom! Shoom!
We are to fight now? Let's go!
Chitali!
Neeko teach you a lesson.
Rey'amash!
"Bright means danger!
Yachisha!
Battle time! Whoop whoop!
Like a wildcat! Rawr!!
Kehkehta!
Ice bird woman! Woo! Neeko need coat.
Fa hasici! It means I like you. In a good way.
After fight, can Neeko tell you about Oovi-Kat tribe?
Hello, nature! Nature here looks funny.
Wow! We do not have that where I come from.
Nidalee! Weird seeing you here. Neeko misses you.
No, Rengar! Be nice and sweet like Nidalee!
Show me more of the world, Taliyah. Take me with you!
You are Vastaya! Neeko is Oovi-Kat. We are... cousins? Distant cousins!
May I touch your eyeball? Neeko is gentle.
Zyra has many thorns. Too hard for Neeko to get past.
Hello, enemy!
You are not secretly Neeko, are you?
Can our spirits be friends still...?
Told you to not get close. Why did you not listen?
Neeko will keep your sho'ma alive.
Dee dee dee... Just minding my own business, not being Neeko.
I am being me and doing... me things. Not suspicious.
Be cool. No one suspects you are Neeko.
I am normal! Everything's normal. Nothing is suspicious.
It's fun to walk around in different skins. Ahaha!
I am definitely not Neeko. Nope. Not Neeko.
If Neeko can be everyone, how can Neeko be sure she's anyone?
No one suspects Neeko to not be Neeko and to be not Neeko instead.
Neeko must stay unseen... until the last moment.
Where is Neeko? I saw Neeko by the river. Everyone knows Neeko likes rivers!
Is Neeko far? Is Neeko near? No one knows...
This place tastes like many emotions. Excitement, anger, joy and... salty? Is salty a feeling?
Co-'om se-henna. Oh, it means like, um... 'we smile forever.' Friends! That is the word! Friends!
I want to become everybody! Who says I cannot? I will prove them wrong! Then, I will become them. Last laugh? Neeko!
No more room for problems please. Only room for more cheesebreads.
Every place is beautiful. Every place is danger. Is danger... beautiful?
The air is part of me. So are the flowers and the rocks. Neeko is everywhere.
Changing bodies is like changing minds. Easy. Neeko can do it! Everyone else make it difficult.
Words are tricky. Better to speak with colors and emotion!
Sho'ma is like, um... the shape of someone's spirit, who they really are inside.
Why do people say   Neeko needs answers now!
People say 'The world is Neeko's oyster'. Is oyster a good thing? Taste like grapes?
Sharing memories, colors, feelings is magic! Magic connects people.
Neeko keeps a tiny bit of everybody's sho'ma. They are precious!
The spirits are all around me. Warm, like hugs!
Crush with Eyeliner
Do not be bound to a single body. There are so many more.
What does Neeko do with power? Make people behave.
People with no tails! Are they lonely? Yes.
Stand back! Big strong Neeko coming though!
This is very exciting! Everything is falling down!
Neeko does not want to be here when... the others arrive.
The Oovi-Kats are gone. Neeko is her own tribe now.
After fight ends, everyone invited to picnic! Even enemies.
If Neeko becomes Neeko, what does she look like?
Neeko is on her fourth tail!
Everyone fears Neeko now! Hahaha!
"No, tail! We must be angry now.
I will learn! I will grow! I will... Neeko!
If Neeko knows your sho'ma, Neeko knows you.
Beauty shines from inside, where the heart dances.
Neeko strong! Can take on world!
Survival means blending in.
Slow down? No! Fast fast fast!
What to do now? Find cheesebreads? Ooh! Have picnic!
How can anybody miss home? Home is all around.
Who stands in Neeko's way? Dummies with small sho'ma, that's who!
Neeko might have a thing for birds. And bird people.
Neeko will not break your sho'ma. I promise.
Nice to be something different for a change!
Now we are bonded. Thank you!
So beautiful! Like moonlight on fresh snow.
Look out! Neeko so fabulous now!
Beep. Boop. Neeko is metal person. Kwatz.
Ahhh!! Neeko on fire! Just kidding.
Not monster. Outsider looking in, wanting to belong. Like Neeko.
Evelynn is so... extreme! Neeko curious...
Pretty! For a boy. Too pretty.
Neeko will try you on for size. Oooh! I love it!
Ohh... Wish I could stay like this forever.
Neeko is joyful to become you!
Life as Garen just simple. Just swing sword around. Very bland, yes.
Yuck! Take a bath. Gross.
Neeko loves everything about strong... I-yao-i? Did I say it right?
The Vastayashai'rei tended your sapling, Green Father.
Jinx is wild! Break everything! Phew! Phew!
I like angry Yordle! STAB STAB! TACOS! SKAAAARL!
Do I smell as bad as I look? Yes.
Looking like boys is, um... takes getting used to.
Male sho'ma feels... strange.
Neeko always wanted to be a mountain!
So many good memories.
So many colors at once. Neeko could teach you new colors, maybe?
Oooh. Spoooky.
Does dragon lady want to eat lunch with Neeko sometime? Maybe?
Hmm... Neeko not the only one who changes.
The light in me knows the light in Taric.
How do three people wear one pants?
Feels same... almost like Neeko but faded.
Neeko feels wrong. Not good. Void is full of never.
I like this very much! Knife-bird woman! KA-KOOO!
Just yordling around. Is that what yordles say?
Ouch! Zyra always too prickly.
A-eh!
Oba!
Boa!
Get ready!
Get ready!
Get ready!
Bidohm!
Jamak!
Neeko was out, but never down.
Poof! Neeko back in her Neeko skin.
Oovi-Kat vacation over. Back to work!
Ugh. Neeko's sho'ma went everywhere. Huge mess. Had to find it all.
Same luck next try.
Tricky tricky! You got the wrong Neeko!
So easy to trick.
Goodbye, fake Neeko!
Nice try, but no Neeko.
Not Neeko! Hahahahaha!
Hahaa! You fell for it!
That worked! I fooled them all!
Neeko is best decision!
