wavs/audio_0025.wav|Can't put me out!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Arrrrrrra! Ya-hooooo!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|I just wanna go home...
wavs/audio_0028.wav|But I wanna help my family...
wavs/audio_0029.wav|I'm so sorry, omele...
wavs/audio_0030.wav|I got you!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Let's go!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Burn it up!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Woooo!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Are you okay, little mummy? Do you need a hug?
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Aww, what a cute stuffed bear. What's his name?
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Oh my gosh, who are these little buddies? Meeps? So cute!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Brand, does your fire heal too? Or is it just for style?
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Gwen, slow down! My omele always says to not run with scissors.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Whoa, am I gonna be as big as you one day, K'Sante? I can't wait!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|So many dogs. Which ones like snuggles most, Naafiri?
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Neeko! Co'om se henna! Oh, did I say that right?
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Nidalee! Can I play with the Pakiti again soon? Pleeeeease!
wavs/audio_0043.wav|You have a big friend too, Nunu? Wonder if I could teach mine to walk.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Oh my gosh, Qiyana! You're so short in person!
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Hey, big dagger cat! My hunting's gotten a lot better. Wanna see?
wavs/audio_0046.wav|"""Book kitty! So... cute! Must... pet!"
wavs/audio_0047.wav|This is so exciting! I just know we're gonna be best friends after this!
wavs/audio_0048.wav|This will be really good practice for when I face the Vidalion.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Whoa, I bet you're pretty strong, huh?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Hey! I'm Milio, and these are my fuemigos. Nice to meet you!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Hi! How do I spell your name? For when I write home later.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Wanna see a neat trick? Woo! Haha, hahaha!
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I don't get it.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|My omele was right about the scissors.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Naafiri, who's a good puppy? You're a good puppy.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|We'll always be friends. Right, Neeko?
wavs/audio_0057.wav|You don't have to go easy on me, Nidalee. I can take it.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Too hot to candle!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Sorry, Qiyana. Please, please, don't hate me!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Told you I was getting better, big dagger cat.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Is this what the Vidalion's gonna be like? Huh, should be pretty easy.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|What would my omele think?
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Fire is supposed to be the breath of life, not the end of it.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|A-are you okay? Do you need help? I can help!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Whoa, you're so strong, Milio!Yeah, I work out.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|I'm justwarming up! Get it? ..N-no?
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Aww, come back! We were having so much fun!
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Qiyana! Once I'm in the Yun Tal, can we hang out like this all the time?
wavs/audio_0069.wav|You guys all look so strong. You can count on me though, I got this!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|This is so cool. My next letter home is gonna be legendary! Tomasín will be so jealous.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Come on, fuemigos! We got a lot of work to do. Let's start...oh! Over here!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|My fuemigos aren't just cute, they're also helpful. Just wait, I'll show you guys.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|The jungle isn't as creepy as it looks.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|If I were back home I might be helping Mama cook, or be feeding the animals with Papa.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|When I'm in the Yun Tal, I'm gonna go back home and help my entire village.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|My family is gonna be so surprised by all the things I've done! I can't wait to tell them.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|I've seen so many new things. Met so many new people. Like thatplant lady. And thatone rock. And thatbig cat.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Feels like the whole world is watching me. I gotta show them what I can do.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|My furnacita isn't as heavy as it looks. I built it myself!
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Elemental magic is easy. You just gotta think about it, and then – bam, fire!
wavs/audio_0081.wav|And then cousin Javi was like: 'You're just a baby'. I'm twelve, do I look like a baby to you?
wavs/audio_0082.wav|My omele always says: 'The sheep that sleeps gets carried by the current'. Wait... That doesn't sound right.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Leaving home, joining the Yun Tal. It's all for my family.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|My omele says joining the Yun Tal will make my family happy. And she knows best. Right?
wavs/audio_0085.wav|I'm gonna be the youngest kid to ever join the Yun Tal! Pretty amazing.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|The light inside us, the inner flame – that's the heart of my fire.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Hey, fuemigo, you okay back there?
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|I wonder who else I'll meet today.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Good thing I like walking.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Did you say something, fuemigo?
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Anyone else gettin' sleepy?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|My fire might look scary, but don't worry. It's totally safe.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|I traveled through another village kinda like this.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|There's fire in every living thing.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|A stain! Mama worked so hard on this poncho!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Gotta keep moving forward!
wavs/audio_0098.wav|I carry my family with me.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|My omele... I hope she's proud of me.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|I miss Mama's cooking.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|I'm gonna show the Vidalion what I'm made off!
wavs/audio_0102.wav|My furnacita is the one light that will never go out.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Did you see that, fuemigos?
wavs/audio_0104.wav|This is the farthest I've ever been from home.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|You can do it, Milio!Thanks, fuemigos!
wavs/audio_0106.wav|I bet Papa is in the garden right about now.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Fire burns, but it doesn't have to hurt.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|The world is so... big.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|My family is my guiding light.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|I'm not homesick, I just really... really miss my bed!
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Lighten up!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Burn bright!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|This should help!
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Woooo!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Scooooore!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|Buh-bye!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|See ya!
wavs/audio_0118.wav|"Tag! You're it!"""
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Aww!
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Ahhh!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Hehaa... Oops!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I meant to do that!
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Here you go!
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Catch!
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Stop, drop and roll!
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Can't stop us now!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Let's spark joy!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Breath of life!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|Yee-haa!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Waooooo!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Hehaaaaa!
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Let's head back, fuemigos. It's break time!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I'm so glad you're here with me, fuemigos. Let's head back to our secret base!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I'll be right back, friends. Stay out of trouble, okay?
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Come on, Milio, let's take a break!Sigh... Fine, only because you're so cute.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|Mama and Papa will never believe what happened to me today!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Ai! I burn my hair again! Mama's gonna be so mad.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|Even when I'm knocked down, my fuemigos always have my back.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|You okay, Milio?Yeah, all good. Let's go again!
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Whoa, you guys see that? That was amazing!
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Gotta burn brighter.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I'm pretty strong. I've been training like... all day!
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Wait, let me write that down real quick.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Friends, assemble!
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Over here!
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Everyone, come here!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Stick with me! I'll keep you warm.
