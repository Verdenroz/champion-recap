Rell_Original_Assist_0.wav|rell|en|I could learn to trust someone like you.
Rell_Original_Assist_1.wav|rell|en|Didn't expect the assist. Thanks.
Rell_Original_Assist_2.wav|rell|en|Alright, I'll admit you helped.
Rell_Original_Assist_3.wav|rell|en|You're dependable. I like that.
Rell_Original_Assist_4.wav|rell|en|You'll watch my back? Just like that? Cool.
Rell_Original_Assist_5.wav|rell|en|Don't get comfortable. I work alone.
Rell_Original_Attack_0.wav|rell|en|Guess we're doing this!
Rell_Original_Attack_1.wav|rell|en|You can't fix what I break!
Rell_Original_Attack_10.wav|rell|en|This'll shut you up.
Rell_Original_Attack_11.wav|rell|en|This is who I am now!
Rell_Original_Attack_12.wav|rell|en|Oh, we're fighting!
Rell_Original_Attack_13.wav|rell|en|Don't say I didn't warn you!
Rell_Original_Attack_14.wav|rell|en|Say goodbye to your teeth!
Rell_Original_Attack_15.wav|rell|en|Hey, idiot!
Rell_Original_Attack_16.wav|rell|en|I'll bust you down to scrap!
Rell_Original_Attack_17.wav|rell|en|You! You're in my way!
Rell_Original_Attack_18.wav|rell|en|Alright. Die then.
Rell_Original_Attack_19.wav|rell|en|Now I'm mad!
Rell_Original_Attack_2.wav|rell|en|This is for everyone I've lost!
Rell_Original_Attack_20.wav|rell|en|I will kill you!
Rell_Original_Attack_21.wav|rell|en|They'll find you in pieces.
Rell_Original_Attack_22.wav|rell|en|You're nothing.
Rell_Original_Attack_23.wav|rell|en|Out of my way!
Rell_Original_Attack_24.wav|rell|en|Step up then!
Rell_Original_Attack_25.wav|rell|en|You're too soft for this!
Rell_Original_Attack_26.wav|rell|en|You got a problem?!
Rell_Original_Attack_27.wav|rell|en|Hope you brought an army!
Rell_Original_Attack_28.wav|rell|en|Sit down!
Rell_Original_Attack_3.wav|rell|en|I don't move for anyone!
Rell_Original_Attack_4.wav|rell|en|Dumbest fight you've ever picked.
Rell_Original_Attack_5.wav|rell|en|Do! Not! Push me!
Rell_Original_Attack_6.wav|rell|en|This is gonna suck for you!
Rell_Original_Attack_7.wav|rell|en|I told you to stay back!
Rell_Original_Attack_8.wav|rell|en|I'm pissed!
Rell_Original_Attack_9.wav|rell|en|Here comes an ass kicking!
Rell_Original_Death_0.wav|rell|en|I can't stop fighting...
Rell_Original_E_0.wav|rell|en|Get mean!
Rell_Original_E_1.wav|rell|en|Toughen up!
Rell_Original_E_3.wav|rell|en|Don't die!
Rell_Original_E_5.wav|rell|en|I got you!
Rell_Original_E_6.wav|rell|en|We fight together!
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterCassiopeia.wav|rell|en|Hey, snake. I'm gonna crush your bones.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterDarius.wav|rell|en|You know my dad, General. So you know what's about to happen.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterEkko.wav|rell|en|O...Oh. So your name's Ekko? That's... that's cool. I'm cool.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterElise.wav|rell|en|Bet the rose would sure hate losing their pet bug.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterKled.wav|rell|en|You know I can see you, right? Gross little gerbil man...
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterLeblanc.wav|rell|en|Hey, LeBlanc! Tell my mom I'm gonna rip her head off!
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterLeona.wav|rell|en|All right, Rell. Be cool. It's just a tall, super-strong armored lady.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterMordekaiser.wav|rell|en|You're Mordekaiser, right? All metal. I can take you.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterSamira.wav|rell|en|Samira. If you're looking for me, here I am.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterSeraphine.wav|rell|en|You're cute, Seraphine. Uh, well, bye.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterSett.wav|rell|en|More like the boss of having his shirt off. Oh, I think he heard that.
Rell_Original_FirstEncounterSwain.wav|rell|en|Noxus will fall, Swain. Starting with you!
Rell_Original_JokeResponse.wav|rell|en|Boo, you suck.
Rell_Original_Joke_0.wav|rell|en|I'm the happiest girl in the world...
Rell_Original_Joke_1.wav|rell|en|Wheeeeeeee.
Rell_Original_KillCassiopeia.wav|rell|en|One dead snake, one less petal on the rose.
Rell_Original_KillDarius.wav|rell|en|You shoulda kept better tabs on your people, General.
Rell_Original_KillEkko.wav|rell|en|Ugh. Just when I thought I knew him, he went back in time.
Rell_Original_KillElise.wav|rell|en|One evil spider lady down, several evil animal people to go.
Rell_Original_KillKled.wav|rell|en|Your lizard had the right idea. 'General-Admiral-Brigadier' Kled.
Rell_Original_KillLeblanc.wav|rell|en|Good. That'll send mom the message.
Rell_Original_KillLeona.wav|rell|en|I hope this won't hurt my chances, Leona. Leona?
Rell_Original_KillMordekaiser.wav|rell|en|Noxus was afraid of that guy? This might be easier than I thought.
Rell_Original_KillPenta.wav|rell|en|No one beats me, no one breaks me, and no one stand in my way!'
Rell_Original_KillSamira.wav|rell|en|So long, Samira. Thought you'd be more stylish than that.
Rell_Original_KillSeraphine.wav|rell|en|We would not be good together, Sera.
Rell_Original_KillSett.wav|rell|en|Does this mean I'm your boss now? I gotta walk away, this is too much.
Rell_Original_KillSwain.wav|rell|en|Hmph. 'Grand General.'
Rell_Original_Kill_0.wav|rell|en|Beaten by a girl, to death.
Rell_Original_Kill_1.wav|rell|en|Let's try that again. Hi, I'm Rell.
Rell_Original_Kill_2.wav|rell|en|Someone scrape this idiot off the floor.
Rell_Original_Kill_3.wav|rell|en|Thanks for the practice, stupid.
Rell_Original_Kill_4.wav|rell|en|Onto the next.
Rell_Original_Kill_5.wav|rell|en|I told you not to fight me, but here we are.
Rell_Original_Kill_6.wav|rell|en|I've kicked rocks tougher than you.
Rell_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|rell|en|Fight like you mean it. Die for something that matters!
Rell_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|rell|en|This 'little girl' is about to crush some heads.
Rell_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|rell|en|Run 'em all down! We're good, they're bad, and that's all you need to know.
Rell_Original_MoveLong_0.wav|rell|en|They'll pay for what happened to me. Noxus, The Black Rose... everyone.
Rell_Original_MoveLong_1.wav|rell|en|The people who hurt me are dead. All but one. My mother.
Rell_Original_MoveLong_2.wav|rell|en|The Rose ripped the magic out of my friends and put it into me. I hate them.
Rell_Original_MoveLong_3.wav|rell|en|Those academy kids are still out there. I'll find them all. I'll save them.
Rell_Original_MoveLong_4.wav|rell|en|When steel crashes against steel, it's so loud. I almost forget.
Rell_Original_Move_0.wav|rell|en|Memories suck.
Rell_Original_Move_1.wav|rell|en|If I trusted people, I'd need even more armor.
Rell_Original_Move_10.wav|rell|en|I survived the academy. My 'instructors'... didn't.
Rell_Original_Move_11.wav|rell|en|Noxians aren't the heroes they think they are.
Rell_Original_Move_12.wav|rell|en|I'd rather break rules than people, but I can make exceptions.
Rell_Original_Move_13.wav|rell|en|Bones shatter and people lie, but I can always count on iron.
Rell_Original_Move_14.wav|rell|en|The helpless fight. The hardened live.
Rell_Original_Move_15.wav|rell|en|They call it ferromancy. Metal magic.
Rell_Original_Move_16.wav|rell|en|Forgiveness? Never.
Rell_Original_Move_17.wav|rell|en|Trust is a luxury no one can afford.
Rell_Original_Move_18.wav|rell|en|Forge your heart into something strong, unbreakable.
Rell_Original_Move_19.wav|rell|en|The Rose wanted me to be a weapon. Well, here I am.
Rell_Original_Move_2.wav|rell|en|I'll twist Noxus until it snaps.
Rell_Original_Move_20.wav|rell|en|Friends just get in the way.
Rell_Original_Move_21.wav|rell|en|Hurt me enough and I'll split your head open.
Rell_Original_Move_3.wav|rell|en|I fight for the lost. But mostly, I just fight.
Rell_Original_Move_4.wav|rell|en|I'll finish this fight. I'm the only one who can.
Rell_Original_Move_5.wav|rell|en|These sigils are a reminder. Screw my sigils.
Rell_Original_Move_6.wav|rell|en|Everyone who's ever stood in my way is dead or broken.
Rell_Original_Move_7.wav|rell|en|Don't let anyone in. Never let anyone in.
Rell_Original_Move_8.wav|rell|en|The Black Rose may have done this to me, but Noxus knew.
Rell_Original_Move_9.wav|rell|en|The armor keeps the world out. The lance does the rest.
Rell_Original_R_0.wav|rell|en|Nobody leaves!
Rell_Original_R_1.wav|rell|en|Do not walk away!
Rell_Original_R_3.wav|rell|en|I am not finished!
Rell_Original_Recall_0.wav|rell|en|All this waiting! I just want to fight!
Rell_Original_Recall_1.wav|rell|en|This sucks! I don't have time for this!
Rell_Original_Recall_2.wav|rell|en|Come on! I hate waiting!
Rell_Original_Respawn_0.wav|rell|en|Can't tell if I taste metal or blood.
Rell_Original_Respawn_1.wav|rell|en|'Excellence is measured in sacrifice,' or whatever.
Rell_Original_TauntResponse.wav|rell|en|How 'bout you say that again?!
Rell_Original_Taunt_0.wav|rell|en|Iron body, iron will!
Rell_Original_Taunt_1.wav|rell|en|I refuse to be broken!
Rell_Original_W_Dismount_1.wav|rell|en|I'll fight to the end!
Rell_Original_W_Dismount_2.wav|rell|en|Let's do this for real!
Rell_Original_W_Dismount_3.wav|rell|en|For the null!
Rell_Original_W_Dismount_4.wav|rell|en|Armoring up!
Rell_Original_W_Dismount_6.wav|rell|en|Unbreakable!
Rell_Original_W_MountUp_0.wav|rell|en|Run 'em down!
Rell_Original_W_MountUp_2.wav|rell|en|Ride!
Rell_Original_W_MountUp_3.wav|rell|en|Don't fall behind!
Rell_Original_W_MountUp_4.wav|rell|en|Mount up!
Rell_Original_W_MountUp_6.wav|rell|en|Let's crush 'em underhoof!
Rell_Select.wav|rell|en|Nothing gets in, no one gets out.
