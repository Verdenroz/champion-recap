At dusk, a new game begins.
You're so funny, acting like magic hurts!
Good attacking! It's my turn, right?
I'm over here!
I can't help myself in doing mean things, sorry!
Oh, do you wanna do something, we should do something!
Delightful little world you have... I like it!
I don't mean to hurt you. I just do sometimes!
Don't be boring!
You won't play? I'll make you!
I am called Zoe.
These interactions are pretty weird.
Oh, you silly bean!
So this the type of game you like?
I'm Zoe. What's your name?
Do something fun! The world might be ending... Or not!
Hey, what else is fun?
This is the game you wanna play?
Are you smiling yet?
Hi! My name is Zoe.
Fine weather, isn't it?
Your lives are short, but I love sparkles...
Wanna learn to play bubble stars?
This should be fun.Fun~!
Paradigm shift time!
Hey, whatcha doing?
Tag, you're it! Hey, I said you're it!
I don't want to grow up. You can't make me.

I've got a magic present for you! Here it comes!
I should start a band.
So dizzy...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
I'm dizzy...
Wooh...
Are you from here? I walk between worlds. Well, hop, actually. You're cuuuute...
If you won't pay attention to me, I'll blow up your world! Probably not... but I might!
I'm just saying, if you wanted to hold hands, that would be okay.
I have a question I wanna ask, buuuuut I need you to say yes before I ask it.
You don't own rainbows!
Double rainbows are dumb. You're dumb.
Ooh?
Aww, space dragon should have gotten back on his leash.
I'm gonna miss that cosmic dragon... Oh look, butterflies!
Said he made all the stars, and the humans believed him?!
Cosmic space dragon? Kinda chatty. So arrogant.
I liked your stars, but you're not the big deal you thought you were.
What? No! Why isn't he moving anymore?
Oh no, I think I played too rough!
But now how is he gonna be my first kiss? He's dead!
He was so cute. I mean, uh, not that I noticed. Hehe.
You probably didn't deserve that, Lux. Sorry, but not really.
Oops, I might have gotten a little jealous. Sorry, Lux.
Bye bye 'blondie'!
I do not like yellow hair. And Demacia. And light magic. And everything about her!
'Oh, I'm Lux! I'm so tall, and I like all the boys!' TAKE YOUR SPARKS!
We all grow up! Well, you died, but... y'know.
I amthebest-ah!
Hehe! More chocolate mooncake for me!
You. Were. A poophead!
Gotcha! Nowthatwas more sparkles.
Wait... they aren't coming back?
Goodbye, my new friend!

Sorry! Beauty always has tears. Even when we're happy.
Naptime for you!
Aww, I can hear my favorite wittle space doggy.
I think we're gonna get to play with the cosmic space dragon. He's funny, but he needs better manners.
Space dragons are so arrogant until you train them. We're gonna train this one.

Hey, I'm Zoe! You're Ezreal! I know that! I mean— uh, I found it out! I mean... Awh, kill me now.
I speak of the changes coming. That is our purpose. ...It's a pretty easy job.
Nobody has to grow up if they don't want to. Orrrrr maybe they do. I don't, though.
There is a day we must all fulfill our destiny. ...That day is taco day!
There's this illusion of the reality, but it's not really really real, like it's beside and inside and inside and beside, but never on top... Nevermind, just kidding, but not really..
Hello? Hey, I'm over here if you want to aim a high-velocity attack against me! Maybe you'll hit me this time!
The sky is billions of explosions burning far away! How could you not wanna see them?? I did. They were pretty cool.
Ohh! I like how the atmospheric refraction is favoring intense short waves today!
I bring a message for you all: a warning, a sigil. But first, I wanna see the sparkle flies.

So, there's these, like, yinger and yangerons, and they spin in this projected pattern which intersects fourth-dimensionally. But it isn't a measurable function. It's got a whoosh, whoom, whoooooooooh!
The sky called to me. So I went! It was pretty cool. I like this too, though.
Psst! Hey! Can you tell me your secrets? I promise not to tell them to... everyone!
Dusk and dawn—the ending is the beginning.
Anyone wanna go into that ankle-deep liquid? Hello? Hellooooo!!
We don't try to understand the sense it doesn't make, so we're trying to share that with you. You're welcome.
This will be fine! Don't worry about it Zoe, things break all the time. Like reality, planets... y'know, stuff.
I didn't even know boys existed! Now I just want one to hold my hand and look in my eyes! ...A cute one.
I'm not boy-crazy! I just... don't have a boyfriend yet.
There are holes in reality. And... in donuts.
When the beings here look up, do they think we're looking back?! We really aren't.

The sun and moon rise in time, to ash and mirth. The mountain takes... all. Change comes.
Hey guys, so, cosmic change time, possible armageddon,twilight of the gods, blah-blah-blah — you've been heralded.
Something good is going to happen. With sparkles!
Trickster never loses. Because Zoe changes the rules.
The eye that looks ahead for the safe course is closed forever.
What's fun around here? What about over there!
No one free is afraid of... mischief.
I wonder who's around.
You know, I wouldn't trust me, but I would totally like me. I do like me.
Y'know, there's not enough unicorns here!
The wheel turns, day becomes night... time to make colors!
I hope this world survives... I like it!
Ugh, Targon has rules, but blehh, I'm gonna hang out anyway.
Aaand a skip-skip and a jump-jump!
If this wasn't so pretty, I wouldn't care that it's all about to change.
Time is a tide. All that it gives, it also takes.
I should come here every millennium! I like it!

Well, this is a pretty chill reality.
Starlight is an expression of something inside bursting to get out!
Every day, every season... ends. And begin something new!
I am supposed to give them a message! But I forgot the sonic pattern for it...
There is mischief in the stars. Also gas clouds. They smell like farts.

While I wait, I will stay happy! Oh...
Dusk and dawn are the same. So there's actually two of me. Orrr I could be totally lying.
I'm gonna dance in my superpants. Cause otherwise I would be naked!
I like all these things around me! The creatures. And... and the plants!
Are we done in this reality yet? Hello? Hellooo?
I should figure out a new game. One that mortals can play without dying!
Do not look into the eyes of a god, or fly into its ears.
Ha.
Whoosh!
Ha!
Haa!
POW!
HAHAA!

Ah?- Wee-oo!
Or,what.
Yeah? Well...
Was that... sharing?
Oh. Wow. That's like, totally off the mandala.
Thanks for asking! I like butterflies, unicorns, and watching the end of finite realities!
Ahh... I need a nap.
What's with all the negative waves?
There is another reality inside all of us. Maybe not you though.
You might emerge somewhere else in the sky, somewhen else in time. That would be better.
Is this the best physical representation you can manifest? It completely lacks zazz!
Whoo!
Am I the only one who can see these?
Whamo!
Aw, this spell is neat!
Useful?
Whooo!
Yes, more magic!
You left a copy of your spell here. I took it. Kthx.
Should I have picked this one up?
These beings just leave magic everywhere!
Never enough pockets for these spells.
"Ooh! Oooooh!
More for me!
Whooo!
Guess I'll keep it.
Nice spell!
Yes! This'll be fun! Right?
