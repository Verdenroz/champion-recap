wavs/audio_0001.wav|My genius will be understood—eventually.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Right. On. Cue.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Wonderful.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|There is no drama in a peaceful death!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Symmetry is so boring.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Each bullet will be a dance.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Places everyone, places!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Sublime.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Watch my puppets dance.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Precious.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|When they find you, they will cry.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Smiles, everyone, smiles!
wavs/audio_0013.wav|I couldn't miss your performance.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|I've outdone myself this time.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Center stage!
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Beauty is pain.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Your life had no value before me.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|You will be poetry.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|You will be beautiful.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|I feel inspired.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Transcendent.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Delightful!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Shall we dance?
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Youwillperform.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Each bullet is a song.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|How lovely!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Alright!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|This is my love.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Places, please!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|The composition needs something.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Darling.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|I will touch your heart.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|How can we make this fresh?
wavs/audio_0034.wav|I rehearsed this!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Art is worth the pain.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|I will make you famous.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Inspired.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Dance for me.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|This is my calling.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Divine.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Fabulous.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|They're gonna live, until they die.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|The show never ends!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|This is your curtain call.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Two!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Two.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Three.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Three.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|One!
wavs/audio_0050.wav|One.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|These were clearly designed by a caveman.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Gold is my power colour.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I prefer my equipment to make a bang.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Sometimes, silence is loud.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Start the music. I will make them dance.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|I have a thirst for melodrama.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Redisa primary color.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|The storm is in their hearts. I calm them.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Dune
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I do prefer my work to have a brisk tempo.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|I always execute with style.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|We all wear masks. Mine are just better-crafted.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|Art is such a fickle thing.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Not sure I needed another mask, but oh well.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Ionian footwear. Sadly, so obvious.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|The essence of a thing is found only in its absence.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Life has no meaning, but your death shall.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Face the crowd, and bleed for them.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Nowthatis what I want to see.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|The face of your killer is identical to mine.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Art shall blossom from your fear.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|With my technique, killing blooms into artwork!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|You've awoken something deep inside me.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|I knew you would find your mark, eventually.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|Wait for your cue! You're only here to herald my entrance.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|What a terrible arrangement.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|You shout and throw machetes? How quaint.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|I find your work very, very… obvious.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Clearly you've never performed in Ionia.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|The always-enchanting tale of star-crossed lovers.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Here's the thing, I don't need your god, I need more time for my production.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|There is such a thing as 'too much gold', my dear.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I thought diamonds were a girl's best friend.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|When you speak, I don't hear god, I hear an idiot babbling.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|You can take my soul… if you'll shut up.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|My dear countryman, you remind me how little our culture has advanced.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|I do what others will not. That alone is innovation.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|So many guns, all lacking in meaning or artistry.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Your finale will be a duet.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Your story is revenge with gunsandghosts. How droll.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|How gauche your nation is.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Your war was an impressive production, but it lacked soul.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Your people mistake loudness for import.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|I've been asked to do so many boring performances in your nation.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Noxians treat killing as a sport. It is an art.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|I suppose you embody a primitive minimalism, but you lack my technique.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|You helped lock me away. You tried to stop my work. My art cannot be contained.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I have been planning your final performance for a very… long… time.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I remember your father! He thought he could censor me.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Break a leg! Hehe, oh. 'Break a leg', hehe… ah, delightful. I do cut myself up.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Your music lacks the cruelty of a masterpiece.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Step out of my light! They call it background music!
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Your work will be forgotten. I am ahead of my time!
wavs/audio_0109.wav|You should learn the power of silence.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|You have too many lines.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Oh, before you ask, yes, your whole ensemble makes you look fat. Very fat.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Why would anyone listen to a creature so ugly?
wavs/audio_0113.wav|How inelegant your words are. Surely a fool wrote your script.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Heh… hehe… that hat is ridiculous, now… who let you wear that horrible thing?
wavs/audio_0115.wav|An understudy can't upstage me.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|You belong in the shadows. No audience could love you.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|I remember your master. He was worth remembering.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|I offer an exclusive service. You'll find I murder the competition.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|You think you can stop my performance?
wavs/audio_0121.wav|You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|Only perfectio-gah! … only perfection is acceptable.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|And now, the curtain rises.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|The stage is set.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Our performance begins.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I suppose I must make do with this tawdry setting.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|I will bring them an opera of death.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|I serve a discerning clientele.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Let's start the show.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|My work asks questions, it never has answers.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Which is the lie? The mask, or my face?
wavs/audio_0133.wav|The trigger on a loaded weapon… it whispers for us to act.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work?
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I… orchestrate death.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|I will not suffer this ugliness.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|My audience awaits.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|The work is what matters.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Art should terrify.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|I envy silence… because I must be loud.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Happiness… is a warm gun.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|They call me mad. All artists are mad.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|I must wait until the composition is perfect.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Smiles and screams, I bring both.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|My critics are… usually short-lived.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|My clients expect the best.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|An icon doesn't have to explain himself.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|I am at my best only during the performance.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Mmm… the ecstasy of killing.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|The ecstasy of opening night.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|This would be easier if blood came in more colours.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|The moment before the shot… is painful.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|My talent justifies all actions.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Until they stop me, I will keep going.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|It's so difficult to work under these conditions.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|It is only when the gun fires that I am alive.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Behind every mask there is a face, and behind that a story.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|I like a violent composition.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|I am pure. My work is pure.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|There is nothing for me but this.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Only to the audience do I show my true face.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|No poet's words could match my craft.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|My theater is the mind.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|I cannot be good. I must beperfection.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|I can't live without the euphoria of performance.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Death should never be quick. It should be an opera.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|They will dance, they will sing, they willdie!
wavs/audio_0176.wav|I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Yes, the gun is ironic.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Perfection isn't good enough.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Art must exist beyond reason.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|My genius will be understood - eventually.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|I wonder what they think when they see me.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|I am a slave to this passion.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Every element must be in place.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|What sweet sadness is killing?
wavs/audio_0189.wav|I was paid to put on akillershow.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|The end is important in all things.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|I shall choreograph this affair.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Art requires a certain cruelty.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|I inspire action.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Through my work, you shall transcend.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|You will learn what beauty truly is.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|There is art here, waiting.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Smile! Everyone is watching!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|You… inspire me.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Breathe in the atmosphere.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|This… passion… compels me.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Four.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Four!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Four!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Your final scene begins.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Prepare… for your finale.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|That delightful moment before the curtain goes up.
wavs/audio_0210.wav|In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|I have risen from the filth and muck. I am the lotus blossom. I am beauty.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|It hurts so good…
wavs/audio_0213.wav|You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|I have elaborate plans for you.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|You lack imagination.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Killing you will be one of my finest works.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Only my actions will make you memorable.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn.
