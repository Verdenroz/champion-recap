wavs/audio_0001.wav|Humanity can be so much more.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Their bodies are frail.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Adapt, or be removed.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Relinquish the flesh.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|Inferior constructs.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|They are obsolete.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Destroy... then improve!
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Listen close- urgh, I have important- urgh! This is why I can't take you nice places!
wavs/audio_0009.wav|The key to the, uhh... huh? That is the, uhh... what? Urgh! Keep your hand to yourself!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|Pave the way.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|All will soon change.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|Embrace progress.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|Metal is perfection.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Analyzing approach.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|I am the first of many.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Submit to my designs.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|With utmost efficiency.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|Function over form.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Behold!
wavs/audio_0020.wav|Consume!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|Obliterate!
wavs/audio_0022.wav|True power!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Steel can fix all your flaws.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|My opponents need to be upgraded.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|The Hexcore can adapt to any power. Even yours.
wavs/audio_0026.wav|For perfection.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Forget fear.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Incognizant soul.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Embrace evolution.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Change is inexorable.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Conflict is but a distraction.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|You betray your future.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Renounce emotion.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Prepare your mind.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Unite.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Understand. Become.
wavs/audio_0037.wav|A discordant mind.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|No more division.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|How wasteful.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Escape your imperfections.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Amalgamate.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|My purpose...
wavs/audio_0043.wav|No progress... no liberation.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|No progress... no liberation.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|My purpose...
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Remove emotion.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|Adapt.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|End sentimentality.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Adapt.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|End sentimentality.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Remove emotion.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|I'm certainNoxussees the strength in my mission, Ambessa.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|I see you have evolved all on your own, Blitzcrank.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Professor. Have you come to renounce your anti-Hexcore dogma?
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Neither friendship nor love will stop what is necessary, Jayce.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Mel, as one embraced by the Arcane, you now know the true value of Hextech.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|We've surpassed our feeble forms, Orianna. May the rest follow our lead.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|It's not too late for humanity, doctor. I have the power to treat what ails them.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|It is Hextech that holds the answers to your questions.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|I sense... trepidation. But one cannot grow if left unchallenged.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Calamity thwarts hesitation. So which are you?
wavs/audio_0062.wav|All will be clear once I open your mind.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|You challenge the inevitable.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|I offer no choice, for there is none.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Stop. Stop. Stop that! It tickles...
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Humor... a frivolous ornament.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Humor... a frivolous ornament.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|It tickles
wavs/audio_0069.wav|That you broke our alliance is unsurprising, Ambessa. Such are the winds of sentiment.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|That you broke our alliance is unsurprising, Ambessa. Such are the winds of sentiment.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|I have observed that a creation will always reject its creator.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|I do what I must for our future.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|I do what I must for our future.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|You would have us remain insulated in our ignorance, professor.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|You would have us remain insulated in our ignorance, professor.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|We could have ushered in a new era together, Jayce.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|We could have ushered in a new era together, Jayce.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Though we became enemies, Mel, your support will never be forgotten.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Though we became enemies, Mel, your support will never be forgotten.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|It seems perfection is still fallible, Orianna. I must think on this.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|It seems perfection is still fallible, Orianna. I must think on this.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|I am only the beginning.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|I am only the beginning.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Share in my vision!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|The Arcane reaches all!
wavs/audio_0086.wav|All will know Hextech!
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Share in my vision!
wavs/audio_0088.wav|All will know Hextech!
wavs/audio_0089.wav|The Arcane reaches all!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|As a child, I dreamt of becoming you, Singed. How foolish I was.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|I used to enjoy such trinkets.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Humanity's toys.
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Hextech endures!
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Your people failed you,Vander.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Your people failed you,Vander.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|How unnecessary.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|You submitted to your baser instincts.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|You lack the perspective to know your own destruction.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Annihilation over reason.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Unrealized to the end.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|If only our minds had been united.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Why could you not learn from my example?
wavs/audio_0103.wav|They fight against their own preservation...
wavs/audio_0104.wav|If only our minds had been united.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|You submitted to your baser instincts.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|They fight against their own preservation...
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Unrealized to the end.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|Why could you not learn from my example?
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Annihilation over reason.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|You lack the perspective to know your own destruction.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|How unnecessary.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|All will prosper when my purpose is fulfilled. Let us proceed aspartners, Jayce.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|Humanity has stumbled... but I will catch the fallen, and show them the glory of evolution.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|A new era is here. Follow me, and I will give you enlightenment in place of emotion.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|No longer will we be guided by invisible hands. TheArcanewill free us, and I am its herald.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I speak now with not one voice, but many. EmbraceHextech.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Hexcorization requires no justification. What purpose is there in explaining a horseshoe to the horse?
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Mankind clings to its past. Glorifies its present. And lives in dread of tomorrow.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Machines are near perfect. I will make humanity even greater.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|Emotion and logic cannot coexist. One must be shed to gain the other.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Governed by instinct, humans are no more than flawed and flailing animals.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I am the only one with the means to cure suffering. But it is a lonely path.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|I chose to become this. Difficulty had no bearing nor did danger. It was... necessary.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|They think humanity can survive with emotion? Survive as what? Creatures blinded by impulse?
wavs/audio_0125.wav|What I am doing is not torment. Torment is allowing the mind to corrupt the soul.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|Sentiment is incompatible with control.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|The time for leniency has passed.
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Passion double-crosses, subverts, divides.
wavs/audio_0129.wav|This world will know magnificence.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Emotion... clashes with reason.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Perfection is within their reach...
wavs/audio_0132.wav|All that is logical is true, absolute, irrefutable.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I did not know true...beauty, until the Arcane.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|They mistake pragmatism for malice.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|True change must be imposed, not offered.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|I alone see what must be done.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|To live with flaws, is to be subject to them.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|We will supersede nature.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Without the Hexcore, death would have claimed me.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|Humanity... is self-corrupting.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|So much of what we value is inconsequential.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|I won't forget the lives lost in my pursuit of excellence.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|The Hexcore is humanity's transcendental catalyst.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|All will soon change.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|My comfort with death comes from proximity, not ignorance.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|I am not the man I was, but who I wished to be.
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Doubt has been purged from me.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|The Arcane is the answer.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Hextech will unitePiltoverandZaunonce and for all.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|No one need live with doubt anymore.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Perfected!
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Unrivaled!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Indomitable!
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Indomitable!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Unrivaled!
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Perfected!
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Transformation.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Order through chaos.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Behold the Arcane!
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Sublime!
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Evolution fast approaches.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Evolution fast approaches.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Sublime!
wavs/audio_0164.wav|Transformation.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|Behold the Arcane!
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Order through chaos.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Progress is not a straight line.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|There are too many variables. I must reevaluate my calculations.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|I see every possibility and outcome laid before me.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Dissonance distracts from purpose.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|This conflict is best resolved by other means.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|Evolution has stalled in my absence.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|The secrets of the Arcane defy reality.
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Why would I be brought back if not to enact change?
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Where one possiblity ends, another begins.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|I will not waste this life. Not for them, not for me.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Hextech's power bends the petty rules of life and death.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|In another life, this would have seemed... impossible.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Death always brings new perspective.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|There will be no need for shopkeepers after theGlorious Evolution.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|I warn you... I evolve beyond these transactions.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Emotion... corrodes the soul. As does money.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|I have no vanity to indulge.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Surprise me.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Hmm. A curious provocation.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Hmm. A curious provocation.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Surprise me.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Expected outcome.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|Bound together.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Unavoidable.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Bound together.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Unavoidable.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Expected outcome.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Sequester!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Suspend!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|Impede!
wavs/audio_0197.wav|Confine!
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Dulled perception.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Disruption.
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Slow to act.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Dulled perception.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Slow to act.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Disruption.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|Sequester!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Impede!
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Confine!
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Suspend!
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Join the glorious evolution.
