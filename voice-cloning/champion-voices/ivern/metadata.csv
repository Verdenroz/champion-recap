wavs/audio_0001.wav|Happy to sit this one out.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|Dragons and void beasts are beyond my aid.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Why aren't dragons andvoidbeasts friendlier?
wavs/audio_0004.wav|I get the feeling dragons don't like me too much... Oh well!
wavs/audio_0005.wav|That creature is not ofthisworld.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Nature isn't always gentle.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Let me help you grow.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Turn a new leaf.
wavs/audio_0009.wav|Huh, I can be thorny too!
wavs/audio_0010.wav|The scorpion must scorp.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|Wake up!
wavs/audio_0012.wav|When a tree hits you, listen.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You forced my limb.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|Switch to a greener path.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|Some buds need a little push to blossom.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Trust me, you need this.
wavs/audio_0017.wav|Harm revisits those who harm.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|It's okay, Gromp is a slow learner too.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|So this is how the scorpion feels.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|See the wonder!
wavs/audio_0021.wav|How very hornet of me.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|Haa!
wavs/audio_0023.wav|Hah!
wavs/audio_0024.wav|Hehehehe!
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Hmph!
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Tehee!
wavs/audio_0027.wav|Uh!
wavs/audio_0028.wav|Hahaa!
wavs/audio_0029.wav|Ooh!
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Haha!
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Ehe!
wavs/audio_0032.wav|Oops!
wavs/audio_0033.wav|Poke!
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Uh-- the ferns did it.
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Nature strikes unseen.
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Poke!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|Who did that?! ...It was me.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|The chameleons would be proud.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|Sneak attack!
wavs/audio_0040.wav|No one expects the sneaky clover.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|Where did that come from?!
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Surprises sting the most.
wavs/audio_0043.wav|Pokey!
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Poke.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Nothing in here but us, uh... stalks of grass!!
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Poke.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|I hope I don't outgrow these.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|These are so much better than the mudloafers I've been using.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|Oh, I love boots! Where do they go again?
wavs/audio_0050.wav|This looks like it's going to grow on me!
wavs/audio_0051.wav|Hey, it's a thingy... people... use! Thank you!
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Take all the gold, I really don't need it.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|Hah!
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Hoo!
wavs/audio_0055.wav|De-doo!
wavs/audio_0056.wav|Whoo!
wavs/audio_0057.wav|Timber!
wavs/audio_0058.wav|Tree down!
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Tree down!
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Timber!
wavs/audio_0061.wav|Timber!
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Tree down!
wavs/audio_0063.wav|The forest protects us all.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Nature's surprise!
wavs/audio_0065.wav|A gift from the forest.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|Be protected.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Use this gift well.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|Sometimes I need to treat myself.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|I've got two thumbs and a shield!
wavs/audio_0070.wav|Life is so much more beautiful than death.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Finally, someone who understands nature like I do!
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Mountain man, it's me! The tree guy!
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Are you going to Treemoot this year? I'm going to dress up as a sassafras!
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Obviously, you're not a gopher.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|No need to be so thorny.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|Hmm...
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Hmm...
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Hmm...
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Oh?
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Oh.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|That gets funnier every time I hear it!
wavs/audio_0082.wav|That's the funniest thing I've ever heard!
wavs/audio_0083.wav|Hmm. Fragrant, with notes of wormwood.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|Be grateful for this moment. And this one. Oh, and this one. Oh, and this one's good too!
wavs/audio_0085.wav|The druid abides.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|Have an Ivern-crisp apple! Don't ask how I make them.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|Once in a blue leaf, the earthworm will best the robin.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|Live each day as if it's your first.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Feels good to stretch the ole beanstalks!
wavs/audio_0090.wav|What a wonderful day! Gooseberries would love it.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|The sunshine tastes so good today.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Hm, now where did I leave my roots?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|I am never lost in the wilderness... only in conversations.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Daisy stampede when no one is watching.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|I follow only the sun! A-and sometimes a river. This one time, a scorpion...
wavs/audio_0096.wav|Never trust a butterfly with a secret.
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Sun and rain are the only magic I need.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Life is such a strange miracle.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Trees love tickling each other's branches.
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Laugh like a hyena, and friends will gallop to your side.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Every river reaches the ocean in its own way.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|I grow my own food.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|I wonder what adventure today has in store for all of us.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|Animals have more to offer than warm pelts and meat.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Everything is connected in the strangest ways.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Ladybugs should really befriend inchworms.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|I love how the grass is fluffy on my toes.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|I'm having another eye-opening day.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Sprint like a snail, and you will never twist your ankle.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|It's reassuring how alone we aren't.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|I find that the stranger life gets, the more it seems to make sense.
wavs/audio_0112.wav|I want to put my toes in the river.
wavs/audio_0113.wav|I tread lightly so as not to hurt the dandelions.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Nothing beats the smell of vegetation.
wavs/audio_0115.wav|One day, I'll root in one place and be everywhere.
wavs/audio_0116.wav|I wonder what the ducks are plotting today.
wavs/audio_0117.wav|Potatoes are always watching.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|The cleverness of mushrooms always surprises me!
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Brush just tickles my fancy.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|I should go swimming later!
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Danger is coming.
wavs/audio_0122.wav|We are one.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Hunters overrun the forest.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Malice is afoot.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|Do not linger here.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|I am your friend!
wavs/audio_0127.wav|I gift my spark!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|We are connected!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|May you blossom.
wavs/audio_0130.wav|Our spirits are one.
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Grant me your spirit.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|Don't fret, Blue. Moss builds character.
wavs/audio_0133.wav|Blue, stunning as always.
wavs/audio_0134.wav|I'm telling you, Blue, you and Daisy would make a cute couple.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|And how are the pebbles, Blue?
wavs/audio_0136.wav|You look just like my friend Daisy.
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Stay calm, Blue.
wavs/audio_0138.wav|You know me, Blue.
wavs/audio_0139.wav|Be peaceful, Brambleback.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|You know me, Brambleback.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|Brambleback always has the best jokes!
wavs/audio_0142.wav|Don't start fights, Brambleback.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|Looking good, Brambleback.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Brambleback, remember the Kumungu affair? I still think it was your fault.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|Brambleback, thanks for helping the beavers move their lodge.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Hello!
wavs/audio_0147.wav|Hey there!
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Hello!
wavs/audio_0149.wav|Hello.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|Oh, hello.
wavs/audio_0151.wav|Hello.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Gromp, no leap races now!
wavs/audio_0153.wav|Gromp! The epitome of frogdom.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Lord Grompulous Kevin Ribbiton of Croaksworth. I am at your service, my liege.
wavs/audio_0155.wav|You know me, Gromp.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|Gromp, ribbit, Gromp.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Top of the morning, Gromp!
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Few understand the true spirit of the noble Krugs.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|Krugs, there's danger afoot.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|You know me, Krugs.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|Krugs, bring it in for a cuddle!
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Hey, Krugs, how's the wife?
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Krugs, you're a boulder amongst pebbles.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|May I come near, Krugs?
wavs/audio_0165.wav|I loved your last story, Krugs! Really need to punch up act three, though.
wavs/audio_0166.wav|Settle down, Raptors.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|Have you heard the Crimson Raptor's singing? She's come a long way.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|When's the last time you had your beaks sharpened?
wavs/audio_0169.wav|You know me, Raptors.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|Have some bird seed.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|Raptor friends! Looking good, guys!
wavs/audio_0172.wav|I'll be back soon, Scuttles.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|Poor thing, who bent your antenna?
wavs/audio_0174.wav|Found any good crawdads lately, Scuttles? Let me know if you do!
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Scuttles, you're a gentle crab and a scholar.
wavs/audio_0176.wav|You know me, Scuttles.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Scuttles, relax.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|I know I still owe you some razor clams, Scuttles. You know I'm good for it.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Everyone needs to run with a wolf pack every now and then.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|Wolves hate being alone, even the lone ones.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|I told you to get that second head looked at, Wolfy.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|You know me, Wolves.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Don't stay long, Wolves.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|No, Wolves, we're not playing fetch now.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Wolves, be still.
wavs/audio_0186.wav|Let me help you grow.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|Given freely to those in need.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|Be valiant, like a honeybee.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|A gift from the forest.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Sharing is caringâ€”says the dung beetle.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Always replace whatever you take.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|To take, one must first learn to give.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|Nature gives so much more than it asks for in return.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|Say hi to your spawn for me!
wavs/audio_0195.wav|Hurry! Get to safety!
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I will use your essence well.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|I receive your power with gratitude.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|Thank you, Blue!
wavs/audio_0199.wav|They want to take your essence! Hide!
wavs/audio_0200.wav|Red, Code Red! Flee!
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Red! It's the Kumungu affair all over again!
wavs/audio_0202.wav|Thank you, brother Brambleback!
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Run, they seek to steal your fire!
wavs/audio_0204.wav|See you later, Red!
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Hide, Gromp, I'll find you later.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Return to your pond, Gromp.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|Go in peace, friend.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|Thank you, lord Gromp.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Hide, Krugs, run back to your wife!
wavs/audio_0210.wav|Thank you, Krugs.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|Live to finish your tale.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|Fly along, now, danger is nigh!
wavs/audio_0213.wav|Where did you Raptors get all this gold?
wavs/audio_0214.wav|I treasure this essence.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|Scuttle, watch the river for me.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|Quick, Scuttle Crab, hide!
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Nothing escapes a Scuttle Crab's perception.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|Thanks, Scuttles!
wavs/audio_0219.wav|Scuttle, keep an eye on that suspicious extradimensional monstrosity, would ya?
wavs/audio_0220.wav|We'll play fetch later.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Thank you, dear Wolves.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Hunters on the prowl, run and hide!
wavs/audio_0223.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Gotcha!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Whahahaa!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Whoohoohoo!
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Hoohoo!
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Heha!
wavs/audio_0232.wav|Whoo-hoooo!!
wavs/audio_0233.wav|Ooh!
wavs/audio_0234.wav|Whoohoo!
wavs/audio_0235.wav|Whahaa!
wavs/audio_0236.wav|Hah!
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Careful, Daisy doesn't know her own strength!
wavs/audio_0238.wav|Watch out, Daisy's really protective of me.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Daisy just loves to hug!
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Daisy, be gentle.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Watch out, Daisy stampede!!!
wavs/audio_0242.wav|I think Daisy has a crush on you!
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Don't play possum! Daisy hates possums!
wavs/audio_0244.wav|See you later, Daisy.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Bye, Daisy!
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Bye, Daisy.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|Thanks for playing, Daisy.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|Bye bye, Daisy.
wavs/audio_0249.wav|Daisy, up high!
wavs/audio_0250.wav|Daisy!!!
wavs/audio_0251.wav|High five, Daisy!
wavs/audio_0252.wav|Daisy, break up the fight!
wavs/audio_0253.wav|Meet my friend Daisy.
wavs/audio_0254.wav|Daisy, high five!
wavs/audio_0255.wav|High five, Daisy!
wavs/audio_0256.wav|Daisy, gimme' some leaf!
wavs/audio_0257.wav|Hmm? Oh, hello. Shhh. Hmm-hmm... Woohoo!
wavs/audio_0258.wav|Woohoo!
wavs/audio_0259.wav|Hm, this new body's a little stiff! Must be an oak!
wavs/audio_0260.wav|Woooo! Hahow! Haha!
wavs/audio_0261.wav|Dying isn't so badâ€”now that the dying part's over.
wavs/audio_0262.wav|Haha! Woohoo, haha!
wavs/audio_0263.wav|That old body was getting creaky.
wavs/audio_0264.wav|Woohoo! Haha! Ta-da!
wavs/audio_0265.wav|Woohoo!
wavs/audio_0266.wav|The end of life is filled with life.
wavs/audio_0267.wav|Yes, you too!
wavs/audio_0268.wav|Good one!
wavs/audio_0269.wav|Oh, you got me on that one!
wavs/audio_0270.wav|Have an unusual day.
wavs/audio_0271.wav|Be grateful for the breeze and the grass beneath your feet.
wavs/audio_0272.wav|Let reverence for life take root in your heart.
wavs/audio_0273.wav|I'm a tree-hugger, you should know that about me!
wavs/audio_0274.wav|All life is precious, yes... even yours.
wavs/audio_0275.wav|May the sun warm you, all of your days.
wavs/audio_0276.wav|What shall I see?
wavs/audio_0277.wav|Keep an eye out for new friends.
wavs/audio_0278.wav|Never hurts to be carefully carefree.
wavs/audio_0279.wav|Let me know if anyone tramples you.
wavs/audio_0280.wav|Nature is always watching.
wavs/audio_0281.wav|A worm's eye view often turns into a bird's eye view.
wavs/audio_0282.wav|Oh, a feather-backed caterpillar!
wavs/audio_0283.wav|Now, I'll see them see me.
wavs/audio_0284.wav|Sprout.
wavs/audio_0285.wav|Bloom!
wavs/audio_0286.wav|Sprout!
wavs/audio_0287.wav|Spring up.
wavs/audio_0288.wav|Bloooom!
wavs/audio_0289.wav|Spring up!
wavs/audio_0290.wav|My favorite color is spring.
