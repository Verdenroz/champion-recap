It's just business.
Here's where I get my cut.
Feed the jackals.
This one's on me.
Crack 'em like a tomb.
Step light, strike hard.
Victory is what I'm paid for.
Don't get between me, and my gold.
Another fight, another fee.
You're worth my time... dead.
Life's cheap. Death pays.
Make me work for it.
I go where the trouble is.
Easy pay.
It's just business.
You die for free.
Back off!
Nice try.
Ascension is a problem, I'm the solution.
Keeping the Ascended in line is a full-time job.
Looks like trouble runs in the family, eh, Azir?
That forked tongue could use a matching forked face.
Oh, look. I'm about to step on a snake.
You always were a snake. Now you look the part.
Your inner beauty really shines through, Cassiopeia.
I could use a pair of croc-skin boots.
You'll make a nice bag.
Alright, Azir, let's put your Ascension to work.
They say the desert is a cruel mistress. I like the sound of that.
Cut-purse? No. Cut-throat? Yes.
Send more goons, I think it's working.
Yeah. I am that good.
This ismydesert.
I do my own dirty work.
Take back what's ours.
Come to my desert, pay my price.
Business is good.
Another contract completed.
You can't tame the desert.
I make my own fortune.
Laws are whatever works at the time.
Get paid, and get out.
Loyalty isn't earned. It's bought.
Wealth is my kind of burden.
I've got values - they stack up nicely.
Heroes go hungry.
Honor is the rust on a dull blade.
The only thing I look up to is the sky.
It's not stealing if they're dead.
You've got a problem, I've got a price.
I'll fight for a cause. I won't die for one.
Take this!
Look up. See the buzzards circling?
You can't take it with you, so give it to me.
Takes a lot to stay at the top.
I always take my tollâ€”blood or gold.
