Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_14.wav|aurelion_sol|en|The stories they tell about me? They're probably true.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_15.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Targon will be the pyre from which I forge a new heaven.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_16.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Stars are wonder and love ignited.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_17.wav|aurelion_sol|en|The heavens diminish without my attention.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_18.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Nothing kindles wonder like the beauty of stars.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_19.wav|aurelion_sol|en|This sun could do with a new core.

Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_24.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Each star is one of my hearts.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_25.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I wouldn't navigate by the stars. They are a work in progress.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_26.wav|aurelion_sol|en|This sun is off its axis. It's been driving me crazy for eons now.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_27.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I would burn the cosmos to catch Targon in the flames.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_28.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Planetary life... the insufferable byproduct of dim stars.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_3.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Darkness is my only true enemy.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_30.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Any relevant species has been knocked back into the Stone Age once or twice.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_31.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I kindled the furnaces of wonder.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_32.wav|aurelion_sol|en|With a few more basic elements I could really make this place shimmer.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_33.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Stars never align for anyone... except me, of course.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_34.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Wherever I am is the fashionable part of the universe. Even here.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_35.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Stars are not born, they are made... by me.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_36.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I spark passion into star fire.

Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_38.wav|aurelion_sol|en|The stars are not to thank for any 'good luck' one may experience.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_39.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Targon's magic is crude, but potent.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_4.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I grieve for every star never born.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_40.wav|aurelion_sol|en|As Targon's influence wanes, mine grows.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_41.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Whenever I think my work is complete, I end up back here, under this sun.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_42.wav|aurelion_sol|en|The depths of space crawl with terrible entities. Pray they ignore this world.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_43.wav|aurelion_sol|en|A star's birth is as violent as it is breathtaking.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_5.wav|aurelion_sol|en|A star is so much more than a luminous sphere of wonder.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_6.wav|aurelion_sol|en|My works are revered by worlds I have never even visited.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_7.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Targon has used me as its weapon for far too long.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_8.wav|aurelion_sol|en|All beings are made of the same stardust.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Move_9.wav|aurelion_sol|en|If you ask me, we have set the bar too low for sentience.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_QEnd_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|And I'm barely trying!

Aurelion_Sol_Original_R2_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Another mass extinction, so soon?
Aurelion_Sol_Original_R2_1.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Let's end this on a high note!
Aurelion_Sol_Original_RRankOne_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|It's beyond too late to seek cover.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_RRankOne_1.wav|aurelion_sol|en|This will be quite the deadly spectacle.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_RRankOne_2.wav|aurelion_sol|en|My sphere of influence grows.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_R_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Expanding my horizons.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_R_1.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Time for a great expansion.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Recall_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Always know when to make an entrance... and an exit.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Recall_1.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Don't miss me too much.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Recall_2.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I've seen enough.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Recall_3.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Always leave them begging for more.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Respawn_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Because I am a star dragon. That's why.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Respawn_1.wav|aurelion_sol|en|It's not a comeback if one was never truly gone.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Respawn_2.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Stars never fall.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Respawn_3.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Energy never dies.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Respawn_4.wav|aurelion_sol|en|With a lifespan as comically brief as yours, I suppose I can allow you to taste triumph at least once.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Respawn_5.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Hello again. Let's have some fun.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_0.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Your demise will be sung about for ages to come... only thanks to its proximity to me, of course.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_1.wav|aurelion_sol|en|What is the definition of underwhelming? Oh, right! You.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_2.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I shall be the last thing you see. Lucky you.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_3.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Make a wish. See if the stars answer. I'll wait.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_4.wav|aurelion_sol|en|I used to wander the stars. Now I'm stuck down here, with you.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_5.wav|aurelion_sol|en|On other worlds, there is emerging life more complex than you.
Aurelion_Sol_Original_Taunt_6.wav|aurelion_sol|en|Your survival is not impossible, only very...very...very unlikely.
