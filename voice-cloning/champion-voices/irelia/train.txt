Tyrant!
Give them no foothold!
Eyes up!
Oho… you've got lead feet.
Mind your form.
Slice through them!
Invader!
Stay composed.
Step with me.
It's us or them!
Careful—I hit back.
Always attack at an angle.
The dance begins.
We stand or perish!
Wewillresist!
No appeasement!
You'll rue this day!
Follow my lead.
Our time is now!
Balance be damned; wipe them out!
Push them back!
There is no retreat!
Never surrender!
Show them no weakness.
Wemustprevail!
It's all in the footwork.
Still mind, swift movement.
On your toes!
No room for error.
For the fallen!
We are sharpest where we break!
The blades fly in sync.
Spirit guide me!
Strike fast, and without misstep!
And; breathe.
Shall we?
Look, a dance partner!
Care to dance?
This dance kills despots!
Leave this land!
A sword with a grip? How quaint.
Doesn't fly, but it cuts nonetheless.
Throw it in with the others, let's see if it flies.
Steals their life, like they stole our land… I like it.
Gives life as it takes it… much like the Spirit.
Such a sordid weapon… but effective.
I don't care who made it, so long as it kills invaders.
A beast of a blade for beastly foes!
Woe to all who would harm us now!
The ultimate in homeland protection!
Land, name, and nation. Long may they live!
Give all and the Spirit gives back!
Now, watch the bastards fall!
The blades are honed; let us test their edges.
(Gasp) Zelos…
(Gasp) Spirit… (whispering) Why…
Fight… on….
(Gasp) O-ma?…
Stop your flirting Nine-Tails, it's time to take up arms!
I admire your spirit. Your attitude, not so much.
In Ionia we have over two hundred species of talking dragon! Sorry, not impressed.
Ugh. Your songs are impossible to dance to.
We don't need legends to save us. We do ourownfighting.
Nice technique. I miss your old hair though. Why'd you change it?
IONIAAAAA!Hmm, that's me, if I was you.
Eugh, your twirling technique is atrocious.
You dance to your own rhythm; but the land is beating the drums of war.
Where did you go wrong? Is there anything redeemable in you…? It's time to find out.
Somewhere, a forest is missing its idiot.
I'm about to cut your wind! …Wait, n-not like that, I meant my blades are going to… (sigh) Never mind.
Your 'peace' leads to nothing but extermination!
You claim to speak for the Spirit… as if it doesn't move my blades.
Keep your 'balance', ours is the only side that matters.
Soon, they will grieve inyourvillage.
Your dances are good, but they lack acertain… soul.
You want redemption? Join me, and kill your masters!
You know what it's like to lose everything. So you know why I must fight.
Lobbing poison from your ship doesn't make you a genius. It makes you a coward!
Really… Flying blades? Get yourownthing, sister!
Make yourself useful! Return your crystals to the earth.
Were you the one who brought the ravens?  Because I think they just got caught in my blades!
For a 'brilliant tactician' yousurepick unwinnable fights!
Did you wannalose the other onetoo?
Humans. Vastayans. We are all Ionians, facing a common threat!
Once an Ionian, always an Ionian. You'll never be one of them.
Contrary to what you've heard, I have agreatsense of humor.
(Clears throat) Wai-wai- uh, wait…
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no… (clears throat)
(Grunt of anger) Hang on…!
Wait, wait, wait, wait…
Killing you won't bring them back… But it still felt good.
That's for my O-ma.
Bury them in Noxus! This ground will not have them.
Grace bends, where strength breaks.
One less tyrant.
Do try to keep pace.
Perfection of form.
I dance on your grave.
And… back to center.
It's always the blade you don't see coming.
They made their choice.
Okay! I'm warmed up.
(Chuckle) A fool forgets to watch his flank.
Always mind your footing.
A successful ambush!
(Chuckle) …Hope they learned their lesson.
Leave them. As a warning to others!
Wewilllive on… Either in victory, or in the scars we leave on them!
Let them come! This land will be their graveyard!
They await my words… What should I tell them…?
I have but one life to give for Ionia. Imustmake it count.
We stand on the bones of the ones who came before us. For them,we fight!
You do not know burden until you've seen a thousand people hanging on your every word.
I did not light my O-ma's lantern. I don't want her to see this slaughter.
Father, mother, Zelos, O-ma, Ohn, Kye, little Ruu… None of them ever had a chance.
Givetheman inch, they'lltake a kingdom.
A single pebble may sink a warship… And athousandpebbles… (laughs quietly)
Better times there were, and will be again.
Do we want to be safe, or free? The choice is ours.
Remember what's been lost; fight for what hasn't been.
Zelos told the worst jokes… How I miss them.
Be the leader they need.
If they capture me they'll kill me… (chuckles quietly)If.
We are the children of theFirst Lands; and we willnotbe slaves!
I move to unsung melodies and unbeaten rhythms.
I carry alotmore than these blades.
Ours is the land of magic, andthatis worth dying for.
They came for our magics. They'll pay with their lives.
There's a saying: 'Never fight Ionians on their home soil'.
They didn't kill us all.
Harm no one… Unless they come for your home.
I never meant to lead. I fought, and they followed.
Each form has a name known only to the wind. At least that's what O-ma said…
None can do what I do; so I will do it.
Stay ready, and there is no need to get ready.
A mastered weapon needs no haft.
Dance with what brought you—in this case, blades.
We are theonlymasters of our fate!
Peace requires two participants.
I am not unfriendly! I am a warm and caring person.
Freedom has a demanding rhythm.
I have walked the silver plains and fished the rivers of grass. The land knows me.
Peace must sometimes be bought with blood.
I've never killed a person… just a lot of Noxians.
Of course I can fight. I grew up with four siblings!
(Laughs) They thought they could tame our land.
We do this for those who came before us, and those who come next.
To live under a boot, is not to live.
The voices of my brothers still carry on the wind…
Their weapons are great—but our will is greater.
They'll know me as the last to lay down her weapons.
Ionia is our only home.
Where they fell, freedom grew.
An ocean separates us; for good reason.
Ireallyshould've stretched first… Oh well.
I remember when I danced for fun.
Act, and the whole world will move!
What strange power works through me, I do not know.
Live today like you're going to die tomorrow.
Never stop learning. There's always a form you don't know.
Naruto
Even if they kill me, they'll still have to fight the land.
I am both the tranquil sea and the tempest.
My O-ma always said I had angry feet.
These blades were whetted on the bones of tyrants.
Yes! Catch them unaware.
Of course. I'll set the trap.
Brilliant. They'll never see it coming.
I'll draw them in, you take their flank!
Right, hit them from two sides.
Take out their necks! The heads will follow.
Shall we fight back?
Remember why we fight!
Hold your ground!
We do not die this day!
Cast off your shackles!
Letmetake the lead!
I do not want your praise. Just your sweat and your blood!
Dig in!Thisis where we make our stand!
I will cut a path!
I will not let them harm you!
To the last!
Freedom is yours! Take it!
Press on! We can quit when we're dead!
Keep your form! Move as one!
Stand strong!Nothingcan break us!
For the bones of our fathers, and the temples of our gods!
Give me your all! I swear it will not be wasted!
Make them remember, so they do not return!
Step.
Two.
Whirl.
Lift!
Ohn!
Zelos!
Kye!
Ruu!
Go.
Si.
Ki.
Jun!
Ionia still stands!
Cut them off!
Ionia calls!
Break their lines!
Now!
Stop their retreat!
Leave none alive!
Remember the Placidium!
Well. Time to find my feet.
When no one's around, I dance for myself.
It's quiet now… Time to find my own rhythm.
(Sigh of relief) Alone at last… I'll make the most of it.
We must stay moving. Keep them guessing.
I am the great river, flowing where I please.
The Spirit revives me… I willnotdisappoint.
My form was off… Can't let them see.
It appears my dance continues.
Ugh! Need to get my rhythm back.
This is far from over. We have not yet begun to fight.

Everyone has something clever to say… Until the blades find their throat!
Can you not hear the music? I shall enjoy watching you trip.
Here are our terms. You leave, and you live.
Raise a hand to us, and you'll find it missing.
We are all creations of the Spirit. Still—I must kill you.
The eyes are the first line of defense.
Never again.
Look sharp!
My guard isneverdown!
Always expect them.
I know they'll be back…
Stay watchful, stay prepared.
This time, we'll be waiting for them.
Fight for the First Lands!
