Poor form!
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
They dare not strike back.
To the death.
Strike quickly, strike deftly.
Insolent peasants!
Run them through!
I never hold back.
I am an artist with a sword—in more ways than one.
Talent, honor, discipline... and pretty pictures!
Sharp blade, sharp mind.
At once!
Is this supposed to be a challenge?
In the blink of an eye.
Precision, and grace.
I have no equal.
Do not hesitate!
Such unrefined style.
Others try—Isucceed.
Submit. You have already lost!
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Too slow!
Poor form!
One step ahead!
Try again.
Try me!
En garde!
Stand ready!
Your move.
I long for a worthy opponent.
