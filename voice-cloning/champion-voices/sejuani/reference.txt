I won't be denied!
Trample them!
I was born for conquest.
Leave no survivors.
Die with weapon in hand.
I rule the Freljord.
I was forged by winter.
They will feed my boar.
Seize what's ours.
Show them our teeth.
Bristle, attack!
I won't be denied!
Run them down!
Easy, Bristle. The archer's mine.
Which will snap more easily? The bow, or you?
Ice Witch, prepare to be shattered!
Are icicles the best you can muster?
Can you smell 'coward', Bristle? Get 'em!
Who wants a treat? Bristle wants a treat? Not until we've trampled our foes to dust!
We settle this, here, and now!
We fight while cowards talk.
I will rule the Freljord.
Bristle seems hungry today...
There is no strength in servitude.
We bow to no one!
You own what you take.
Ride onward!
Fight or make room for those who will.
No spoils for the meek.
I will not hide behind another shield.
Pain is nothing.
Living in fear is not living at all.
A gift from the Freljord!
There's no use running!
Flee like the cowards you are!
Those who oppose me get gored.
Don't worry, Bristle, I'll leave you the scraps.
Die!
Trust nothing but your strength.
