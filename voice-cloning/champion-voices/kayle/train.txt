I see you lack judgement.
Surrender and I'll make this quick!
Fear the cleansing fire.
Pay for your sins!
Darkness begone!
Trial by fire!
Fire reveals truth!
I bring the light's wrath.
Be judged!
Save your excuses.
Stand and be judged!
You deserve this.
Justice unyielding!
Avarice falls!
You fall short!
I will not bend!
Righteous glory!
By divine edict!
Heretic!
Rejoice at your redemption!
Guilty!
No sin too small.
For virtue!
Light and glory!
The wicked shall burn!
Burn!
I deem you lacking!
Kneel before the light!
This is your penance!
Deceiver!
No mercy!
The wicked shall fall!
Why do you think I wear armor, sister?
I am not frail!
Think you're the only one?
And you damn yourself.
No mercy!
No mercy!
I'll ignore that.
How 'gracious' of you.
I didn't say 'thank you'.
Better a broken heart than ashackled soul.
Are you following me or something?
Not murder. Justice.
What had to be done.
Hmph. You never had any fear...
How beautiful your mind must be to think such things.
Today, it seems we must put our animosity aside.
Do not turn your back onme, sister!
Your sword is with me. Do you want it back?
Still playing with your little human pets, sister?
Why have we wings, sister, if not to fly?
Are Yordles small children?
My cold heart is the reason we are alive.
My laws have more merit than your whims ever will.
I am the light!
No... My wings...
I dim...
If I... Could see my sister...
Let loose the flame!
I bring the light's wrath!
Endure!
Fear me.
You Demacians have lost your way.
You seem worthy, Garen. Now prove it.
A throne won't save you from my judgement,  .
Lux, the complicit are the worst sinners.
Sister, have you come to defy me again?
Your power could save this world, Morgana; instead, it dooms you.
Funny... You're on my list, too.
You may have been innocent once, Sylas... No longer.
Are you a talking animal? Tiny mortal? Why are you so soft?!
I am the consequence of your actions.
There is no hiding from the light.
If you were innocent, I would not be here.
Evil fears only fire! And Yordles, because, what evenarethey?
A thief, a murderer, and a corrupt guard, all walk into my sword. The end!
This world didnotdeserve you.
Slain by your own sword.
I am exalted!
Your guilt was clear.
Thus, the mighty fall.
Buried with your transgressions.
Here to make excuses for their darkness, sister?
I shall battle my maudlin twin once more.
Morgana is here. How I relish the opportunity to battle my dark shadow.
My sister is here—to fall before me again, no doubt.
With the just hand of law I enter the fray, unbound by this mortal pettiness.
When I looked into my mother's eyes, I saw a paradise for the just and glorious. It is for that world I fight.
Grant me the strength to forge by flame, a world beyond worlds.
In me will rise the strength of a thousands swords... The fury of a thousand flames...
These endless mortal cycles... Cruelty begets suffering. Suffering begets cruelty... It ends with me.
The greater the evil, the greater its opposition!
Iwillbring justice to this world, no matter the cost!
I shall purge the dark within, and rise in glory!
I shall purge this world of evil, and the fires of Justice shall vanquish the darkness!
Let me grow stronger, that I might vanquish the forces of darkness. Let me transcend mortal frailty.
Live long enough, and all lies crumble to dust!
Injustice is a festering rot; and I am its cauterizing blade.
Only those with malice in their hearts need fear the light!
Only the divine may judge.
I do not fear the holy fire. I must become it.
Mortals are blinded by their own misery.
What is dark in me, I will illuminate.
The righteous path begins with me.
The divine path shows no footsteps.
A clean cut divides darkness and light.
Emotions are a weakness.
The light of my devotion will set the world aflame.
The moment justice bends, it breaks.
To find grace, I cannot fall.
I must feel nothing to fight injustice.
This world was not made to last.
To withhold justice, is a dark sin.
On wings of fire, hope ascends.
Truth, guide my sword!
There is right, and there is wrong. All else is rationalization.
Where there is evil, I shall go.
I took up my mother's sword, and with it, her purpose.
If I slip, I will fall—and so I must fly.
Iwillgrow stronger...
I fly for the glory that shines above this caustic din.
Excuses do not concern me, only actions.
Only the innocent will be spared.IfI can find any!
Celestial justice, guide my blade.
The path to the light, is a lonely one.
The past is for sinners. The future is for the repentant.
The just rise above this mortal soil.
No human is perfect... butIam not human.
I shall purify this land, with fire if I must.
I am divine wrath.
I cannot rest. I will not.
Would that my path be true.
I remember pain... It made me weak.
I am anointed in the fire of absolution!
They will break against my stalwart heart!
I am born from the flame of their sins.
I was purified in the light.
Burn all deceivers!
Wings of Immortal Flame, lift me from mortal temptation!
I am the Light and the Glory!
My sword is named 'Virtue', and it burns eternal!
The fallen will never rise again.
Their deeds shall be weighed on the scales of stars!
My devotion is unbreakable!
Only the guilty need fear me.
The just cry to the heavens. I answer.
The law does not tolerate imperfection. I am no exception.
To be human is to be imperfect, but I am not human!
I have given up everything for the light.
Only the just walk the path of immortal light.
The fire that illuminates, also cleanses.
Make thyself devout, and eternal life is granted.
Justice is swift when borne on the edge of a blade!
My flames burn only the unworthy.
As evil grows, so shall I.
These blades... my sanction!
The unrighteous will burn!
Behold, the righteous flame!
I am your salvation!
Sister!
Redemption in the light!
The worthy survive!
I am your salvation!
Drown in holy fire!
Redemption, in the light.
I salute the Fallen.
The celestial realm awaits.
The light renews.
They cannot kill justice.
Still copying my hairstyle, sister?
Surrender to the light, and I will spare your soul!
Ready to be judged?
Flame purifies.
Flame purifies.
Heal by fire.
They shall tremble at my perfection.
