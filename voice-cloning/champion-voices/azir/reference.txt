Your emperor shall return.
No beast will stop us!
Emperors have no need of barons.
We will overcome this monster!
No dragon can defeat us!
Even dragons look up to the sun.
I have no fear of dragons.
V for Vendetta
You dare oppose me?
Mine is the will of Shurima.
They dare defy Shurima?
I will open their eyes.
They have overstepped.
The unworthy have no place in history.
Who denies our right to rule?
Soon, none will question us.
Never cross an emperor.
Challenge Shurima, challenge fate.
Give yourselves to Shurima.
Ancient power courses through me.
Fate is in our hands.
Behold the desert's wrath.
With a word, I end you.
Eventually, the sands claim us all.
Shurima will brook no offense.
May the sands of Shurima always be under our feet.
I will shift as the sands.
Time itself serves Shurima.
The Hunger Games
How...?
Shurima...
Trust in me!
My decree is made!
This spider will be trampled in our march.
Renekton, once a noble warrior, now naught but a mad beast.
Here, we shall decide the future of Shurima!
Rise with Shurima, Sivir, or fall beneath it.
You are but a grain of sand, Xerath.
The future will be written by the Ascended!
Today, you will see the power of Ascension!
For emperors, it's all about how you carry yourself.
So, a pigeon walks into a bar...
Teach them to respect Ascension!
It is your turn to carry our great legacy.
It is you who are in my web, spider.
This is but one step on a long and glorious path.
Shurima will know only victory.
You have forgotten yourself, Renekton.
Accept your destiny, Sivir.
You must learn respect, Sivir.
Xerath, the time of your judgment has come.
You are but my shadow, Xerath!
You have already failed, Xerath. You must now accept it.
Xerath, it is time your spark went out.
None shall ever question the power of Shurima!
Destiny halts for no one.
Traitor, I cast you to the winds.
Nothing is beyond my reach.
Your sacrifice is part of a greater plan.
At last, Shurima will reach its destiny!
Let us return to our rightful place, Nasus.
It has been a long wait Nasus... but it will be worth it.
Together, we shall strive toward victory, Sivir.
It is our right to rule, Sivir.
Emperors have no rivals, Xerath. Only liabilities.
The world is a desert. I am the oasis.
Shurima will once again stretch to the horizon.
It is my time. Put your faith in me.
Shurima is where all paths converge.
I will guide us to glory.
We are the authors of history.
All eyes look to us.
We walk a path of radiance.
This slumbering world must awaken.
You need not follow, but you must witness.
Loyalty will be rewarded.
No sacrifice is too great.
Believe in our future.
There is no future without Shurima.
We will unearth what has been lost.
Those who follow me follow destiny.
The power of the sun lives in Shurima.
A ruler must choose his hour.
The Ascended shall guide humanity to greatness.
I am Shurima's dawn.
Shurima's legacy will endure.
None know the will of the desert better than I.
My empire lives in every grain of sand.
We are made by our choices.
Everyone will know the name Shurima.
Join me, and be elevated.
Shurima lives in me.
I will return Shurima to greatness.
Rise again!
Arise.
Return.
An idol of greatness.
My city lives on.
You cannot topple Shurima.
Return from the sands.
Shurima is never lost.
Return!
I claim this for Shurima!
Serve me!
This is Shuriman land.
Arise!
Recognize your emperor.
This now serves Shurima.
Conquer!
Kill.
I am Ascended.
Shurima is eternal.
Glory to Shurima!
My soldiers march on.
Your emperor shall return.
I will reclaim my stolen legacy!
You need not follow me, but you cannot stop me.
Like the sun, Shurima always rises!
The bounty of Shurima still flows.
I will be reborn.
Emperors never die.
I am testament to the glory of Shurima!
When every trace of you is lost, I will remain.
What is the desert, but the ashes of my enemies?
There is only Shurima. All else is but a mirage.
Trust in my vision.
I am Shurima's vision.
The light of Shurima.
Soldiers, onward!
Bury them.
The order is given!
Shurima! Your emperor has returned!
