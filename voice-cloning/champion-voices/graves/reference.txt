End of the line.
Like fish in a barrel.
They picked the wrong fight.
Go ahead. I like moving targets.
This is gonna tickle.
Think I'm bluffin'?
Aaw,  tarnation...
Everyone's a hero... till you shoot off a leg or two.
I like my enemies two ways: dead, or about to be.
Easy, partner.
Got any bright ideas?

What are you playin' at?
Try me.

Night-night!
Lights out.
All in.
Lights out!
Night-night!
All in!
Bettin' blind.
Bettin' blind!
I got your 'darkness'.
Who's in the dark now?
