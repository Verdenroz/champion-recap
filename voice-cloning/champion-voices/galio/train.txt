Back to sleep, then...
Now this will be a fight for the ages.
Greetings, fellow large thing, let's fight!
Yes... now that's a fellow I can punch!
Hello, beautiful. What are you doing here?
My wings versus yours. Let's go!
Ooh, a giant crystal? I'll fight it.
Greetings, giant glowing mineral! I must break you.
Heh, stone on stone!
Let us make violence, fellow rock man!
It's like a weaker version of me.
You're a sentinel? I'm a sentinel! We should fight!
At last, a worthy opponent.
There is only room for one of us.
Well hello there, handsome.
Well met, giant zapping man!
I got the big guy!
What are you looking at?
Smash.
Bring it.
Not a fair fight.
To battle!
Wanna go?
It's punch o'clock!
We don't have to fight. Let's do though!
Yes!
Hahaha! This never gets old.
Magic goes in, might comes out.
So many things to squash!
Stone cold.
Justice.
Hmhm, people break.
Boom!
Punching time!
Crunch!
Go time!
Fight me, small warrior person!
I. EAT. MAGIC!
Honor.
Good thing I don't bleed.
So... what do you people do when you're not fighting?
You're going to need some mending.
Smashing power amplified!
A paginated collection of words!
A book! Oh, just need someone to turn the pages for me.
Eh, never been much of a reader.
Armour, kinda makes you feel like you're made of stone.
Hmm... it doesn't fit. Well, guess I'll just hold it.
Cloth will protect my rock hard skin!
Can I exchange this for a size seven-thousand?
Glacial? Oh, that sounds big.
For the Frozen Throne!"
Protect me, tiny ice shield!
I know, I'll wear it as a ring!
Looks dangerous... let's fire it up!
Might need to loosen that a few hundred notches.
Belt's a... little tight.
So cold, yet it makes me feel all warm inside.
Haha, ice fist!
Punchy spikes!
Unleash your power, magic frozen fist!
Hmm... looks red.
Haha! Tiny.
To plug my cracks.
I'll use it as a toothpick!
Make me stronger, purple zapping stick!
That builds INTO something.
I don't know what this is. I bet it's great though!
Hmm... doesn't come with instructions.
Hehehe, I like buying person things.
I am cracked...
Mend... me...
I... crumble...
Knuckle up!
Haymaker!
Punch!
Crack!
To your face!
Better bite down!
Fist!
Aha!
Up you go!
Bustin' heads!
To the chin!
Whammo!
Get your guard up!
Freedom punch!
Lights out!
Uppercut!
ve always wanted to fight the sun. Let
You're from space, huh? I'd fight space. Bring it on!
Hey, World Eater, I've got something you can snack on. It's my fist!
Dang right, Demacia!
Summon your god, painted priestess, and we'll see who's mightier.
You're a Jarvan? I swear, I've met at least three others.
You. Young girl person. Can you stay and accompany me wherever I go?
Hm. How strange. No one bothered to sculpt you?
So, what's it like living underwater? Fought any whales?
I like you, small blue thing. You're the one who doesn't change.
Back to your hole, giant crawly worm.
Hahaha! Ours would be a fight for the ages! They'd find pieces of us for miles around!
You look horrid! I should give you the name of my sculptor.
Do not raise your claws at me, furry growly man.
Looks like I'll have to punch down. Hmph. Way down.
I don't fight small things. Come back with something bigger and meaner.
What awful material were you sculpted from?
My middle name is Justice. Galio Justice Justice.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum.
Oops! Friendly fire.
Who's still standing?
Hahahaha! Did we win yet?
Squish, squish, squish!
Ooh, that was glorious.
Too easy.
Splat.
Squish.
Eww, dead guy in my toes.
Like a bug.
Next!
Vanquished!
You know what's hard about fighting? Nothing! Come on, I'm made of stone.
I've got a high tolerance for magic. Takes a lot for me to feel it.
As a symbol of this great nation, I say... let's go mess up some mages!
Know of any battles? Just looking to get my wings dirty.
People are funny. They pass beneath me doing the same thing day after day.
I'd like to apologize in advance for ruining this place.
Let someone else be a statue, I got stuff to do.
I don't wake up 'til its time to squash something and I'm awake right now.
I love Demacia! It's the only place I've been.
One people year is fifty Galio-years.
I'm going. You try moving three hundred tons.
I'm a big man with big needs.
I might be made of stone, but that doesn't mean my heart is.
Apparently I'm some sort of big deal.
Excuse me, but... which king are we on now?
Let's move! I've got people to inspire!
Do I get to crush that? Oh, please say yes!
Who wants to get protected?
It's time to move! Shake off the moss.
Going to sleep means saying goodbye.
People vanish! And new ones take their places! It must be magic.
Hahaha, majestic? Is that what I'm supposed to be?
I don't break easy.
It's hard to be a symbol, when you've got a soul.
The best offense is a good magic absorbing colossus.
Which way's the fun?
Whoa! I didn't know I had a tail!
The best defense is me.
I am not going back on the pedestal, not yet...
Get behind me, huddled masses!
I know, it's completely unfair. I didn't ask to be this impressive.
Ah, mages. I love the way they squish.
They say I'm all made of petricite, I say I'm all guts!
I wish mountains had fists. That'd be a good fight.
I love walking, it sounds like thunder!
I wish they'd chisel me a friend. Someone who won't break!
People live such tiny lives!
They made me to stop magic, and yet I hate when it's gone.
I didn't choose to come to life, but I definitely prefer it.
Hmm, must be some powerful magic around here.
I sleep, I wake, I break things
What should I break next?
It's not easy when everyone looks up to you.
I'm supposed to be a symbol. Of what, I'm not so sure.
Tragedy is worse when you can do nothing about it.
I always wonder what lies beyond this land. Something to fight, I hope.
Ahh, feels good to stretch my wings.
At last a change of scenery!
Ah, the world, it goes by in a flash.
They just don't make doorways big enough.
I've seen much, not sure I understand it but... it... it happened.
Somehow I always end up in the center of everything.
I fell in love with a crag-beast once. Oh... wasn't meant to be.
The guy that made me, he was pretty good right?
I fought a house once. I'm pretty sure I won.
Can someone please get the pigeons out of my head?
Letmedo the heavy lifting.
I don't know why life chose me, but I'm glad it did.
I haven't been to many places, so I might as well like this one.
Big blast!
Smash!
Right!
That's it!
And back!
Hammer fist!
Feel the whoosh!
Whiff!
Wind!
Flap!
Blow it down!
Both wings!
Wing blast!
Feel the breeze!
Wing punch!
My wings, your face!
Hi everybody!
Need a break from clobbering.
Everyone stay put. I'll be right back.
Time for some fresh mortar.
Oh, I hate to miss out on the action...
Demacia calls.
Phew! I'm tired of punching.
How long was I out?
Ah, how'd I get back here?
Okay, new battle!
Well, we lost that one. Let's go fight something else!
What happened? Was it a frost troll again?
I am chiselled anew.
Hey, I remember this place.
Gargoyle? No, I'm more of a magic-nullifying colossus.
Hmph. Good thing I don't have ears.
You speak a lot, loud talky thing.
Climb up here and say that my face.
I'm sorry, I just woke up. Were we fighting?
Didn't I fight you yesterday, or was that a different puny thing?
Hey, you. Don't mess with Demacia. I saw you thinking about it.
Quick! Hide in my crevices.
Would you like to ride on my massive shoulder?
Rest in my ample shade.
Pick on someone my size!
Take the first swing!
Take your shot!
Come get some!
Don't have long, let's fight!
Fight me! Now!
Gotcha!
Step right up!
Let's get rowdy!
Goin' somewhere?
I can take it!
Haha! Come here!
Let's do this then!
I'll take you all on!
Time to make an impact!
