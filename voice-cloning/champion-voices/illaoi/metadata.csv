wavs/audio_0001.wav|Life is too short for fear.
wavs/audio_0002.wav|I slayed greater serpents as a child.
wavs/audio_0003.wav|Here they call you a monster. In Buhru, we would call you dinner.
wavs/audio_0004.wav|Now... we begin.
wavs/audio_0005.wav|The vortex is all.
wavs/audio_0006.wav|Reality is brutal.
wavs/audio_0007.wav|Youwillbe tested.
wavs/audio_0008.wav|Ha ha ha, you think you can beat me?
wavs/audio_0009.wav|We never stop.
wavs/audio_0010.wav|A good fight.
wavs/audio_0011.wav|To live... is to fight.
wavs/audio_0012.wav|This is the first lesson.
wavs/audio_0013.wav|You are not in motion.
wavs/audio_0014.wav|You stagnated.
wavs/audio_0015.wav|They need wisdom. They don't need teeth.
wavs/audio_0016.wav|Ha! Let's begin again!
wavs/audio_0017.wav|You will be destroyed.
wavs/audio_0018.wav|This is a great day.
wavs/audio_0019.wav|Blessed is motion.
wavs/audio_0020.wav|This will be quick.
wavs/audio_0021.wav|I am here to test souls.
wavs/audio_0022.wav|I am going to walk all over them.
wavs/audio_0023.wav|This fits me better than Gangplank.
wavs/audio_0024.wav|My god is motion, but speed is useful.
wavs/audio_0025.wav|Who is Randuin? Was she a priestess?
wavs/audio_0026.wav|Sterak? It is the fury of themotherI will bring.
wavs/audio_0027.wav|The Kraken. The Serpent. The Hydra. A god's appearance is limited only by those observing it.
wavs/audio_0028.wav|It is my god that protects me, but these metal clothes are nice.
wavs/audio_0029.wav|I like this. I should buy everyone one of these.
wavs/audio_0030.wav|Only what moves, only what lives... has value.
wavs/audio_0031.wav|Things should be held only when we need them.
wavs/audio_0032.wav|It is not what we have, it is what we can throw away.
wavs/audio_0033.wav|When I am done with this... it will make a fine offering.
wavs/audio_0034.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0035.wav|Ha!
wavs/audio_0036.wav|Haa!
wavs/audio_0037.wav|This will be a good day, if you live.
wavs/audio_0038.wav|Drive forward. it is destiny that calls you.
wavs/audio_0039.wav|I don't want you to fail, I want you to learn.
wavs/audio_0040.wav|Seize today, and you've earned tomorrow.
wavs/audio_0041.wav|I don't want you to worship. I want you to learn.
wavs/audio_0042.wav|Now... do you see the truth?
wavs/audio_0043.wav|My god doesn't want you to kneel. It wants you to fight.
wavs/audio_0044.wav|Your soul drowns. Fight.
wavs/audio_0045.wav|Death is only one outcome.
wavs/audio_0046.wav|Each of your lives has served the vortex.
wavs/audio_0047.wav|This... is... the test.
wavs/audio_0048.wav|Every day is waiting to be taken.
wavs/audio_0049.wav|You have been given the tools to know your destiny.
wavs/audio_0050.wav|Take back your spirit.
wavs/audio_0051.wav|You are drowning. I want you to swim.
wavs/audio_0052.wav|Countless lifetimes lead our bodies foward, and drive our spirits towards their true destiny.
wavs/audio_0053.wav|You speak of having a soul. It was never yours. None of them were.
wavs/audio_0054.wav|Your spirit is held, take it if you can.
wavs/audio_0055.wav|Each moment is earned.
wavs/audio_0056.wav|This moment is waiting to be seized.
wavs/audio_0057.wav|The failure of your lives is written on your soul.
wavs/audio_0058.wav|You are the tinest sliver of energy held briefly in shape. Where this energy flows is your destiny.
wavs/audio_0059.wav|Each lifetime is a spirit. Each lifetime is a chance. Take it.
wavs/audio_0060.wav|Our mother demands your tithe.
wavs/audio_0061.wav|All of us are lost, all of us are blind. You must swim towards your destiny.
wavs/audio_0062.wav|Fight and die with purpose.
wavs/audio_0063.wav|I will break you if that's what it takes.
wavs/audio_0064.wav|Change, or you will be pulled down.
wavs/audio_0065.wav|Child, you must earn your soul. Prove yourself.
wavs/audio_0066.wav|What you desire, you must take.
wavs/audio_0067.wav|Fear is good. Use it.
wavs/audio_0068.wav|The battle is lost only when you surrender. Fight for your soul.
wavs/audio_0069.wav|Live your journey, or die in mine.
wavs/audio_0070.wav|We are all free. Seeing the truth only reminds us.
wavs/audio_0071.wav|Love, fight, live.
wavs/audio_0072.wav|Give up, and your life is nothing.
wavs/audio_0073.wav|Altak, kaye-sayu. Altak kaye-sayu. Altak kaye-sayu.
wavs/audio_0074.wav|Uwon shayos kaya. Uwon shayos, kaya.
wavs/audio_0075.wav|I do not walk alone. I am with my god. It is here.
wavs/audio_0076.wav|You cannot hide from god. You cannot hide from the test.
wavs/audio_0077.wav|Tua-shak yaoto. Tua-shak, yaoto, homu.
wavs/audio_0078.wav|Uratu-shak uracheon-mata, rubura-atatufon.
wavs/audio_0079.wav|Chae-yama oka-shai.
wavs/audio_0080.wav|Buhru-lalare-shi Nagakabouros-sho, Naga-sho.
wavs/audio_0081.wav|Behold.
wavs/audio_0082.wav|Nagakabouros surrounds us.
wavs/audio_0083.wav|The truth is all around you.
wavs/audio_0084.wav|This is the motion. All is Nagakabouros.
wavs/audio_0085.wav|You are in motion.
wavs/audio_0086.wav|You have been tested. You have done well.
wavs/audio_0087.wav|You have learned the first lesson.
wavs/audio_0088.wav|You swim well.
wavs/audio_0089.wav|Nagakabouros accepts your tithe.
wavs/audio_0090.wav|Pray I don't have to teach you again.
wavs/audio_0091.wav|Don't make me test you again.
wavs/audio_0092.wav|Did you blunder into victory, or did you learn?
wavs/audio_0093.wav|Learn well, or you will be tested again.
wavs/audio_0094.wav|Exactly. If you want your soul, take it.
wavs/audio_0095.wav|Do not tire, do not slow, push onward.
wavs/audio_0096.wav|This is the way of Nagakabouros: motion!
wavs/audio_0097.wav|Not bad! At least you're moving.
wavs/audio_0098.wav|Again. Push onward.
wavs/audio_0099.wav|Don't stop!
wavs/audio_0100.wav|Yes, you are learning.
wavs/audio_0101.wav|Good, this is the lesson.
wavs/audio_0102.wav|Ha! Well done.
wavs/audio_0103.wav|Your souls wait for you. Take them back if you can.
wavs/audio_0104.wav|To challenge, to fight... this pleases Nagakabouros.
wavs/audio_0105.wav|Keep going, keep striving. This is our way.
wavs/audio_0106.wav|Better.
wavs/audio_0107.wav|Finally, now you are in motion.
wavs/audio_0108.wav|This is how you learn.
wavs/audio_0109.wav|Perhaps you're not hopeless after all.
wavs/audio_0110.wav|We know your true name. We do not fear you.
wavs/audio_0111.wav|Life is not balance. It is motion!
wavs/audio_0112.wav|Foolish spirit, begone!
wavs/audio_0113.wav|You suffered... but learned nothing.
wavs/audio_0114.wav|Your soul is a fetid, stagnant pool, untouched by the tide!
wavs/audio_0115.wav|Foul creature, you would stop time when all things must move!
wavs/audio_0116.wav|You wanted to be a god! Instead, you are a useless antique!
wavs/audio_0117.wav|You are not free from death! Youaredead.
wavs/audio_0118.wav|Abomination! You are without motion.
wavs/audio_0119.wav|Your powers are stolen from the flow. You have damned your homeland.
wavs/audio_0120.wav|You, I like.
wavs/audio_0121.wav|Foolish spirit, begone!
wavs/audio_0122.wav|I know you are strong. I wonder if you have stamina.
wavs/audio_0123.wav|Finally, a man who won't break.
wavs/audio_0124.wav|Northman. There are motions I would like to show you.
wavs/audio_0125.wav|You move well. Now, you must only find joy in the motion.
wavs/audio_0126.wav|You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good.
wavs/audio_0127.wav|Laws, rules, these are falsehoods! Truth is chaos!
wavs/audio_0128.wav|Duty, honor, nations? These are stagnant falsehoods!
wavs/audio_0129.wav|You are slaves enchained by lies when we were born to chase our desires!
wavs/audio_0130.wav|What is truly noble and good would never ask you to serve another!
wavs/audio_0131.wav|Your god was forgotten. Mine cannot be ignored.
wavs/audio_0132.wav|False prophet! You don't even serve a true god!
wavs/audio_0133.wav|I do not challenge you, I bring you the test!
wavs/audio_0134.wav|Your people seek a worthy death. Mine, a worthy life.
wavs/audio_0135.wav|Your people pretend to be strong. I think they are afraid.
wavs/audio_0136.wav|You have learned your lesson, now fight! Kill! Conquer!
wavs/audio_0137.wav|Did she not show you the way forward? Go!
wavs/audio_0138.wav|You want revenge? Take it!
wavs/audio_0139.wav|You paid your tithe to the mother. Now show me what she taught you.
wavs/audio_0140.wav|I do not want excuses. The failure was yours.
wavs/audio_0141.wav|I broke men's hearts. I broke men's spines. You're the first who's going to get both.
wavs/audio_0142.wav|You swim well, Gangplank.
wavs/audio_0143.wav|You are in motion, love.
wavs/audio_0144.wav|Honor? Duty? Ha! What your heart demands is all that matters.
wavs/audio_0145.wav|You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good.
wavs/audio_0146.wav|Dune
wavs/audio_0147.wav|You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good.
wavs/audio_0148.wav|Gangplank will find you.
wavs/audio_0149.wav|The tempest is Nagakabouros. You serve, but are blind.
wavs/audio_0150.wav|I do not challenge you, I bring you the test!
wavs/audio_0151.wav|You, I like.
wavs/audio_0152.wav|Trust the motion. All spirits are Nagakabouros'.
wavs/audio_0153.wav|No love is impossible, my god demands you follow your desires.
wavs/audio_0154.wav|Foolish spirit, begone!
wavs/audio_0155.wav|Your faith asks for obedience. It is weak.
wavs/audio_0156.wav|You worship the sun. It is my god that drives it through the sky.
wavs/audio_0157.wav|Your god offers light without wisdom.
wavs/audio_0158.wav|Gangplank was drowning. Your actions reminded him to swim.
wavs/audio_0159.wav|It is you who have shown Gangplank his path. For that, I thank you.
wavs/audio_0160.wav|Gangplank will find you.
wavs/audio_0161.wav|You are in motion, but only as a parasite on a host.
wavs/audio_0162.wav|Creature, you move, but are useless.
wavs/audio_0163.wav|Ugly thing. You weren't designed by god, you were made by fools.
wavs/audio_0164.wav|You are a foul creation, born from ignorance.
wavs/audio_0165.wav|What kind of stupid god made you?
wavs/audio_0166.wav|You, I like.
wavs/audio_0167.wav|You are a cloud of broken souls, you are an abomination.
wavs/audio_0168.wav|I am your enemy because you offend my god. Because you cannot change.
wavs/audio_0169.wav|Fiend, I bring you true death.
wavs/audio_0170.wav|You will challenge me? Ha ha ha ha... even death fears my god.
wavs/audio_0171.wav|You will trouble this land no more.
wavs/audio_0172.wav|You are not welcome here, creature.
wavs/audio_0173.wav|You are a cycle without purpose. I will end you!
wavs/audio_0174.wav|They have cheated you of rebirth.
wavs/audio_0175.wav|Creature, why would I listen to lies when I can see the truth?
wavs/audio_0176.wav|You move only from hunger that consumes itself.
wavs/audio_0177.wav|Your fine words don't disguise your foul design.
wavs/audio_0178.wav|Gangplank will find you.
wavs/audio_0179.wav|Aw, child, you are cute, but I doubt you will be for long.
wavs/audio_0180.wav|You, I like.
wavs/audio_0181.wav|Change, or feel my god's wrath.
wavs/audio_0182.wav|Little one, I don't need empathy. Seek those who do.
wavs/audio_0183.wav|Go back to where men are weak, and need your inspiration.
wavs/audio_0184.wav|Why would I need a spirit's help? I am guided by Nagakabouros.
wavs/audio_0185.wav|Tentakill!
wavs/audio_0186.wav|It is my burden to carry an eye of god. It is my privilege to see the truth.
wavs/audio_0187.wav|To die is to drown, so I will swim well, till I can swim no more.
wavs/audio_0188.wav|We cannot comprehend the design. A raindrop cannot comprehend a river valley.
wavs/audio_0189.wav|How could I love only one man? They break too easily.
wavs/audio_0190.wav|Wisdom is frequently a kick in the head.
wavs/audio_0191.wav|Motion is all.
wavs/audio_0192.wav|Men live, men die. Change is good.
wavs/audio_0193.wav|They will learn or they will die.
wavs/audio_0194.wav|My god is not love. It is a kick in the pants.
wavs/audio_0195.wav|I am a teacher. Bilgewater will learn.
wavs/audio_0196.wav|I break hearts. I break spines.
wavs/audio_0197.wav|They must be tested to grow.
wavs/audio_0198.wav|This ends one of two ways: they run, or I break them.
wavs/audio_0199.wav|Life is the sweetness of fruit, and the joy of battle!
wavs/audio_0200.wav|I value truth, and barbecue.
wavs/audio_0201.wav|Many gods ask for worship. They are weak gods.
wavs/audio_0202.wav|The waves will drag you down, unless you fight to shore.
wavs/audio_0203.wav|Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros, names don't matter! Action does.
wavs/audio_0204.wav|All that lives... moves.
wavs/audio_0205.wav|Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens.
wavs/audio_0206.wav|Life is too short for fear.
wavs/audio_0207.wav|It is the storm that is life.
wavs/audio_0208.wav|All of us are born storms.
wavs/audio_0209.wav|Good? Evil? Why should we care for such things?
wavs/audio_0210.wav|There are kind and gentle gods. Mine isn't one of those.
wavs/audio_0211.wav|I don't scare, I don't tire, and I don't stop.
wavs/audio_0212.wav|We are born knowing what to do. We must only act.
wavs/audio_0213.wav|The sea is ripe for battle.
wavs/audio_0214.wav|There is joy in food... and fighting.
wavs/audio_0215.wav|My god doesn't want peace.
wavs/audio_0216.wav|The ocean is calm. It is our desires that stir it.
wavs/audio_0217.wav|Many die. Worthy souls find new forms.
wavs/audio_0218.wav|We are not one soul. We are many.
wavs/audio_0219.wav|It is terrible to be satisfied. The world needs us to chase dreams.
wavs/audio_0220.wav|If I hate something, I destroy it. If I want something, I take it.
wavs/audio_0221.wav|Even if I die, I die in motion.
wavs/audio_0222.wav|Chase what is desired.
wavs/audio_0223.wav|My name is Illaoi.
wavs/audio_0224.wav|Now!
wavs/audio_0225.wav|Move!
wavs/audio_0226.wav|Learn!
wavs/audio_0227.wav|Kebouros!
wavs/audio_0228.wav|Shai!
wavs/audio_0229.wav|Naga-sho!
wavs/audio_0230.wav|Altak!
wavs/audio_0231.wav|Behold!
wavs/audio_0232.wav|The truth!
wavs/audio_0233.wav|This is motion!
wavs/audio_0234.wav|All is Nagakabouros!
wavs/audio_0235.wav|All is motion!
wavs/audio_0236.wav|You cannot hide!
wavs/audio_0237.wav|Buhru-latachi.
wavs/audio_0238.wav|Nagakabouros, uki, uki.
wavs/audio_0239.wav|Sheeyutu Nagakabouros. Nagakabouros-shee-shok.
wavs/audio_0240.wav|Buhru-nurataliata-shok.
wavs/audio_0241.wav|Epoi-Buhru, daliet-shee.
wavs/audio_0242.wav|I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
wavs/audio_0243.wav|Live your life, chase what you desire, what else matters?
wavs/audio_0244.wav|A fool and his spirit are easily parted.
wavs/audio_0245.wav|Smile, child, or I'll shove your jaw into your brain.
wavs/audio_0246.wav|Watch your mouth, or I'll slap the soul out of you.
wavs/audio_0247.wav|Fight me, if you have the spirit.
wavs/audio_0248.wav|I'm not big on sermons—broken bones teach better lessons.
