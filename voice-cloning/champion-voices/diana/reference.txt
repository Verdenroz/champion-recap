Ignorant thralls!
Ignorant thralls!
Deny me no longer!
Bring down the sun.
They leave me no choice.
Blind to the truth.
This is necessary.
No more lies.
Knock, knock. Who's there? The moon... It's far away! You were alone the whole time!
A man, a woman, and aYordlewalk into the sun... They die! Because it burns them alive?
Follownofalse light.
I speakonlytruth.
They wouldnotlisten.
Iwillbe heard.
My eyes are open.
Embrace the night.
They couldnotbreak me.
I cannot turn back.
Dusk approaches.
Night approaches!
Dusk!
Nightfall!
Theycalled me a heretic. Now they are dead!
