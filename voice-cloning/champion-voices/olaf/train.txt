C'mon, I won't hurt you. I promise!
My axe is thirsty.
Chop chop!
Death by steel!
Finally, some fun!
Faster to battle!
Obliteration!
The worth of a man can be measured by the length of his beard, and the girth of his belt buckle.
To plunder!
To action!
The might of Lokfar approaches!
I'm going.
C'mon, I won't hurt you. I promise!
Leave nothing behind!
