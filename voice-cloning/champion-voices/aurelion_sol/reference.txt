Hmph. Tragic.
You call yourself a dragon? You're low-flame at best.
Low dragon, unfitting of the name.
A dragon that still needs wings to fly? Keep trying, you'll get there.
I never bite. Too uncouth.
Suns never burn for the benefit of dust.
Return to dust!
What a pity.
Think cosmic... like this!
Boring me is dangerous.
Admire... then die!
Be useful. Be stardust. I'll help.
Too bad.
I'm going to throw a star at you now. Good luck.
Defending yourself? Adorably futile.
Irritating cluster of particles.
I tried to like you.
Impending doom. Exciting, isn't it?
You are woefully underprepared.
Defenses? Laughable.
I'll indulge your foolhardy nature.
Live through this, and we'll chat.
Lighten up, destruction needn't be a maudlin affair.
You are more useful as dust.
Plenty more to come.
Not everyone shines brightly enough!
Illuminate.
Oh, you will shine.
To atoms!
Tedious being.
Be brighter. I'll help.
Dragon's breath it is.
Useless and intolerable. Charming.
Bravery is absurd, but admirable.
Why would I spare such mediocrity?
Melt.
Smolder, then implode!
Congratulations, you have earned my contempt.
They are merely dust.
You will know your place.
Nothing a little star fire cannot fix.
A snow globe? Perfect for my collect—to destroy you.Destroy you!
Liandry's torment... my benefit.
Perfect for the bi-millennial celestial masquerade ball.
If Bard and Kindred can pull off wearing a mask, so can I.
There are no echoes where I'm from.
So many magic staves.
But a shadow of sound.
Hats are always fashionable.
As long as it's set at a jaunty angle, I'm in.
A bit gaudy for my tastes but exceedingly useful.
Time to slow things down a bit.
Shiny, but it's no star.
I tend to burn through footwear.
My feet rarely touch the ground.
Pay? Do you know who I am?
Fine, take your gold...
Just... my... style.
Put it on my tab. The name's Pantheon, with a P.
Good find.
Money? How barbaric.
Put it on Mount Targon's tab.
Join me in the dance cosmic!
Let's dance!
Hello, Runeterra! Are you ready to rock?
Never said I was infallible...
The brightest stars shine on long after they're gone...
Left an exquisite corpse.
Alas, I am simply too beautiful for this world.
Anyone want some stardust?
My, how they stare.
Now we're playing with star fire!
Feels good to make things again!
This'll make them stare.
Stellar!
Accrete!
You aspire to be human!? Oh, darling, there are so many other variants on mediocrity!
I am overwhelmed by an emotion when you are not around. It is called... happiness.
Mages are infants grasping at the machinery behind reality. At least you have a plausible excuse.
You Ascended certainly know how to pick an animal totem.
Your immortality is but a grain of sand in time's vast desert.
Were you born this flat, or did you work at it?
Pick a dimension, Bard, you're confusing them!
The funnier the hat, the greater the prestige, right?
Runeterra. Am I right?
If dunking is the apex of this primitive sport, then I am the queen of space.
It is always a moon's role to envy the stars.
You and Leona embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy.
You're out of your league.
You would make an interesting dragon.
Made a mistake? Better rewind and repeat until you achieve mediocrity.
Fear? Generic.
Idealism? Hilariously outdated.
Rage? Cute.
Gunpowder and metal sticks? Enchanting.
Humanity, surprisingly adept in the art of wrestling survival from the clutches of extinction.
As far as fauna goes, humans strike a firm... middle.
Ah, mankind. Ever fumbling from one brink of cataclysm to the next.
I've seen the main act. You're only a third-rate cover band.
You do not understand your god, Illaoi.
Imagine what you could do with a larger canvas.
Life is short, go crazy once in a while, I get it.
The sun?This sun? Oh, darling.
You and Diana embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy.
All dazzle, no brilliance.
There is a saying on this planet: 'dumb as a rock.' It's not a compliment.
You are going to kill me? Dressed like that?
Bravo, Nasus, you've ascended yourself into a dog! Now fetch me something more interesting.
I could teach an old dog millions of new tricks, but I simply don't like you, Nasus.
Your fate was sealed the moment you picked up Targon's spear.
Are you burdened by your own monotony? Because I am.
That whole practice of Ascension is adorably amusing, like a kitten trying to walk upright.
True magic is beyond language. Writing merely butchers the intent.
Magic tattoos? Where did you get those, magic prison? ...Oh.
Ah, Ryze, I see you've brought paper to take notes.
Medium flame, and that is me being generous.
Almost interesting. Almost.
Darling, you have but set my hearts free.
A dragon's loyalty is a priceless gift. Do not waste it in the service of fools.
Unfitting of the draconic lineage.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star... do you wonder what you are?
The heavens drag on endlessly, much like a conversation with you.
I will cauterize Targon with star fire.
The Aspect of Targon? Sparks masquerading as lightning.
You're anAspect? Let me guess... tackiness.
Oh, come on, have a little self-respect!
Galaxies exist by my will... but, yes, that is certainly an impressive sword.
You are going to punch a star dragon. Good luck with that.
Hm. Punching?
Blood magic? How tragically primitive.
I empathize with your life as a weapon, but have a little backbone.
You bend time the way a child folds origami—cute, but nothing special.
Hm...
Mmm...
Hmm...
Which star is your favorite? I made that one.
Of course I love Runeterra! You have buildings and... more buildings.
A sun is unimaginable celestial power, and thrilled mortals use theirs to coordinate this 'lunch time.'
Few can impress me. That is a compliment.
Runeterra? I mean the name of this world literally means 'magic earth.'
I made the stars, but you... inspire me to make more.
I make entropy look good.
First you start with some matter, then add star fire and voilà! It basically does the rest itself.
You may look forward to more of this.
That ought to keep them talking for the next century or so.
Cosmic dragon: 5. Everyone else: 0. Please, take notes.
Well, that was easy.
Boop.
Boop.
Boop.
Nothing they build can endure like the celestial firmament.
The architects of these towers misunderstand object permanence.
How many must I knock down before they learn?
All towers fall. It's just what they do when I'm around.
Topple, like all things crafted by mortals.
Towers tend to crumble when I am in the vicinity.
My wish upon a star came true.
I shall inscribe this moment in the stars.
Never stop when you're on a roll.
The stars were not in their favor.
I guess their fate was written in the stars.
Starstruck?
The stars weep for you. Just kidding, I already forgot your name.
Nice job, just standing there.
Wrong orbit. Wrong time.
Stars are best viewed from a distance.
In a constantly shifting cosmos, a world this static is... refreshing.
Cower, worship, beg, they're all valid reactions.
There simply are no other dragons like me.
Hope. Wonder. Insignificance. Imagine what they'll feel when I complete the stars.
They call me a comet. They call me a dragon. They have no words for my true form.
Ah, the joys of lesser organisms rising up to slay their betters! If only they were aware of the impermanence of being... or the permanence of me.
Why does anyone wish upon a star?
Perhaps there is more to this world than I thought... not much, but enough.
My stars shine for all.
Only when darkness overwhelms the heavens will Targon realise its folly.
I see a universe drained of light and heat, where not even a story will survive.
I've waited millennia to watch Targon fall.
The stories they tell about me? They're probably true.
Targon will be the pyre from which I forge a new heaven.
Stars are wonder and love ignited.
The heavens diminish without my attention.
Nothing kindles wonder like the beauty of stars.
This sun could do with a new core.
This world holds the key to Targon's undoing.
My home is in the cosmos, amongst my stars.
All terrestrial dragons are but pale imitations of my kind.
Celestial dragons live and die by our own beautiful rules.
Sometimes, the stars gaze back.
Each star is one of my hearts.
I wouldn't navigate by the stars. They are a work in progress.
This sun is off its axis. It's been driving me crazy for eons now.
I would burn the cosmos to catch Targon in the flames.
Planetary life... the insufferable byproduct of dim stars.
Darkness is my only true enemy.
Any relevant species has been knocked back into the Stone Age once or twice.
I kindled the furnaces of wonder.
With a few more basic elements I could really make this place shimmer.
Stars never align for anyone... except me, of course.
Wherever I am is the fashionable part of the universe. Even here.
Stars are not born, they are made... by me.
I spark passion into star fire.
There are countless colors, but I suppose a single rainbow is a good start.
The stars are not to thank for any 'good luck' one may experience.
Targon's magic is crude, but potent.
I grieve for every star never born.
As Targon's influence wanes, mine grows.
Whenever I think my work is complete, I end up back here, under this sun.
The depths of space crawl with terrible entities. Pray they ignore this world.
A star's birth is as violent as it is breathtaking.
A star is so much more than a luminous sphere of wonder.
My works are revered by worlds I have never even visited.
Targon has used me as its weapon for far too long.
All beings are made of the same stardust.
If you ask me, we have set the bar too low for sentience.
And I'm barely trying!
Pure star fire!
Another mass extinction, so soon?
Let's end this on a high note!
It's beyond too late to seek cover.
This will be quite the deadly spectacle.
My sphere of influence grows.
Expanding my horizons.
Time for a great expansion.
Always know when to make an entrance... and an exit.
Don't miss me too much.
I've seen enough.
Always leave them begging for more.
Because I am a star dragon. That's why.
It's not a comeback if one was never truly gone.
Stars never fall.
Energy never dies.
With a lifespan as comically brief as yours, I suppose I can allow you to taste triumph at least once.
Hello again. Let's have some fun.
Your demise will be sung about for ages to come... only thanks to its proximity to me, of course.
What is the definition of underwhelming? Oh, right! You.
I shall be the last thing you see. Lucky you.
Make a wish. See if the stars answer. I'll wait.
I used to wander the stars. Now I'm stuck down here, with you.
On other worlds, there is emerging life more complex than you.
Your survival is not impossible, only very...very...very unlikely.
Never stand in the path of a star.
Time to give them a show.
Time to gather the necessary matter.
None shall tread upon the stars.
Naturally.
