But all my light puns would've brightened your day.
Burn away the shadows!
A beacon in battle.
Any excuse to twirl my wand!
For justice, and all things bright!
Finish the fight!
This is my choice.
Never deny who you are.
The light of Demacia!
Hope you like rainbows!
Curiosity's gonna kill one of us.
Illuminate the enemy!
If you hate magic, you're already blind.
Take courage in the light!
I have to focus, but I can't stop smiling!
Hey, who are you calling a lady?
Lights... out...
Shine bright!
Banish the shadows.
You condemn what you don't understand.
Are we supposed to be... dating... or something? We've never even talked.
Hey, sleepyhead, you coming to the fight or what?
Sibling rivalry... this will be fun!
I'm a Crownguard but you wear the crown. You're a Lightshield but I wield the light. But eh-uh-- I mean, metaphorically, your highness.
Kat and Garen sitting in a tree~ And you better just be holding hands or I'm telling!
The Untouchables
I'm sure your wife forgives you for getting her soul taken by a remorseless creature of darkness!
Demacia and Noxus are just lines on a map.
Do you ever charge into battle screaming, Aw, too bad.
I don't get runes. I mean, are spells really that hard to remember?
You know... you couldn't have shadows without light.
Sona! I'm your biggest fan! I even know what an Etwahl is!
Who do you want to be when you grow up?
Does this make me a lightweaver?
You look like you need a hug... but is it okay if I hold my nose?
Ahaha! I just got the joke!
Would it help if I apologized?
The light will guide youâ€”even now.
I believe in you, not just Demacia.
We're all so concerned about what Demaciais, we forget to ask what itcanbe.
With my magic, and your anti-magic, there's nothing we can't accomplish.
Being a hero kind of runs in the family.
Taliyah, don't be afraid.
Demacia must lead by example.
The sun is shining; we should too.
Together! For Demacia!
Pushing my limits.
Ooh, I've never been here before.
If you can smile, you can be the light.
We can do this!
Keep believing.
Shine with me.
The superior tactic is to never give up.
Into battle with hearts aglow!
Lighting the way.
Stay positive.
Everywhere I go, the light follows.
I want to see everything.
I don't have dark secrets; I have bright ones!
The world has seen enough darkness.
Stay there!
Gotcha!
Binding light!
Demacia!
By the light!
No more holding back!
Losing is just an opportunity to shine even brighter.
The thing about light is... it never really dies.
I'm telling Garen!
Hello, person-who-irrationally-wants-to-kill-me! It's so good to meet you!
We should try being friends first, no?
You don't like me? Well, I'd rather talk to a statue.
We're in this together!
I'll protect you!
Let's light it up!
