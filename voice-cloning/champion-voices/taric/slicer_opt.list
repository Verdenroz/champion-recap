Taric_Original_AttackBaron_2.wav|taric|en|The taint of the Void is upon you.
Taric_Original_AttackDragon_0.wav|taric|en|Greedy beast.
Taric_Original_AttackDragon_1.wav|taric|en|Let's see how hot things get.
Taric_Original_AttackDragon_2.wav|taric|en|Nothing personal, but you've got to go.
Taric_Original_Attack_0.wav|taric|en|I will shatter them.
Taric_Original_Attack_1.wav|taric|en|I serve life, but deal death.
Taric_Original_Attack_10.wav|taric|en|The stars keep the darkness at bay.
Taric_Original_Attack_11.wav|taric|en|Memories are my worst enemies.

Taric_Original_Attack_15.wav|taric|en|Let me make myself crystal clear.
Taric_Original_Attack_16.wav|taric|en|I climbed Mount Targon. You did not.
Taric_Original_Attack_17.wav|taric|en|The heavens strike swiftly.
Taric_Original_Attack_18.wav|taric|en|These gems aren't just for show.
Taric_Original_Attack_19.wav|taric|en|Gems always hold their edge.
Taric_Original_Attack_2.wav|taric|en|The stars care not.

Taric_Original_BuyItemDeadMansPlate_0.wav|taric|en|Let's test this promise.
Taric_Original_BuyItemDeadMansPlate_1.wav|taric|en|Good armor, bad name.
Taric_Original_BuyItemDeadMansPlate_2.wav|taric|en|Not that I'll need this.
Taric_Original_BuyItemFaerieCharm_0.wav|taric|en|This will match nicely.
Taric_Original_BuyItemFaerieCharm_1.wav|taric|en|Something to accent my chest.
Taric_Original_BuyItemGlacialBuckler_0.wav|taric|en|A cold shoulder indeed.
Taric_Original_BuyItemGlacialBuckler_1.wav|taric|en|Work of an artisan.
Taric_Original_BuyItemGlacialBuckler_2.wav|taric|en|Frozen beauty is still beauty.
Taric_Original_BuyItemLocketoftheIronSolari_0.wav|taric|en|Not true Targonian. Still nice, though.
Taric_Original_BuyItemLocketoftheIronSolari_1.wav|taric|en|So misguided, those Solari.
Taric_Original_BuyItemLocketoftheIronSolari_2.wav|taric|en|Feels right.
Taric_Original_BuyItemRedemption_0.wav|taric|en|Targon is always with me.

Taric_Original_E_0.wav|taric|en|Say hello to my little gems.
Taric_Original_E_1.wav|taric|en|Gems hurt, don't they?
Taric_Original_E_2.wav|taric|en|For Targon.
Taric_Original_E_3.wav|taric|en|Blind them with our light.
Taric_Original_E_4.wav|taric|en|Gems are wonderful distractions.
Taric_Original_E_5.wav|taric|en|A little glimmer in their eyes.
Taric_Original_E_6.wav|taric|en|Let me show you something.
Taric_Original_E_7.wav|taric|en|Clarity.
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterAshe.wav|taric|en|That bow is of the stars, as is its mistress.

Taric_Original_FirstEncounterPantheon.wav|taric|en|Ah, the Aspect everyone hates.
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterTahmKench.wav|taric|en|You are weighed down by your petty hungers.
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterTaric.wav|taric|en|I like the cut of your gem.
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterVarus.wav|taric|en|Are you even wearing pants?
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterVelkoz_0.wav|taric|en|They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterVelkoz_1.wav|taric|en|I will enjoy sending you back to the Void. In pieces.
Taric_Original_FirstEncounterVoid.wav|taric|en|I will purge the Void from this world.
Taric_Original_Idle.wav|taric|en|Beauty can be deadly... and manly. Very manly.
Taric_Original_Joke_5.wav|taric|en|Truly Outrageous

Taric_Original_Kill_1.wav|taric|en|Beauty is a job well done.
Taric_Original_Kill_2.wav|taric|en|Never a dull day.
Taric_Original_Kill_3.wav|taric|en|Looks like a mountain fell on them.
Taric_Original_Kill_4.wav|taric|en|In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Taric_Original_Kill_5.wav|taric|en|Fade and begone.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_0.wav|taric|en|There is great power in the stars. Great danger as well.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_1.wav|taric|en|Crash the mountain upon them.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_2.wav|taric|en|The most precious jewel is the one we hold in our heart.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_3.wav|taric|en|There's nowhere left to go but up.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_4.wav|taric|en|The climb may be long, but the view is worth it.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_5.wav|taric|en|I've been to the top of the mountain... and the bottom of the gutter. There's much to learn from both.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_6.wav|taric|en|I have risen beyond the call of banners and kings.
Taric_Original_MoveFirst_7.wav|taric|en|The heavens guide me.
Taric_Original_Move_0.wav|taric|en|Each life is a rare jewel.
Taric_Original_Move_1.wav|taric|en|I may be merciful, but Targon isn't.
Taric_Original_Move_10.wav|taric|en|I am no longer the man I once was.
Taric_Original_Move_11.wav|taric|en|Just as the mountain is eternal, so is hope.
Taric_Original_Move_12.wav|taric|en|We're all headed toward the same inevitable end. No need to rush.
Taric_Original_Move_13.wav|taric|en|Easy on the eyes? Don't I know it.
Taric_Original_Move_14.wav|taric|en|The mountain's mysteries are known to me.
Taric_Original_Move_15.wav|taric|en|The mountain's question is unique for each of us.
Taric_Original_Move_16.wav|taric|en|Why is it always the ugly ones?
Taric_Original_Move_17.wav|taric|en|True gems sparkle even in the absence of light.
Taric_Original_Move_18.wav|taric|en|Truth is worth fighting for, but beauty is worth dying for.
Taric_Original_Move_19.wav|taric|en|To truly see the stars, I climbed.
Taric_Original_Move_2.wav|taric|en|Sometimes, life is worth dying for.
Taric_Original_Move_20.wav|taric|en|The mountain reveals the harshest truths in our souls.
Taric_Original_Move_21.wav|taric|en|The Protector speaks through me.
Taric_Original_Move_22.wav|taric|en|Elegance never helped win a fight, but it never hurt.
Taric_Original_Move_23.wav|taric|en|The stars freed me from myself.
Taric_Original_Move_24.wav|taric|en|The stars were the question. I was the answer.
Taric_Original_Move_25.wav|taric|en|Demacia was my home, but the stars are my destination.
Taric_Original_Move_3.wav|taric|en|We see beauty in the stars, and they see beauty in us.
Taric_Original_Move_4.wav|taric|en|The best weapons are beautiful.
Taric_Original_Move_5.wav|taric|en|The mountain showed me my path.
Taric_Original_Move_6.wav|taric|en|I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
Taric_Original_Move_7.wav|taric|en|Human life is fleeting, a mountain's life less so, but stars... stars are eternal.
Taric_Original_Move_8.wav|taric|en|My heart is filled with starlight. I give it freely to all.
Taric_Original_Move_9.wav|taric|en|Love is simply beauty crystallized.
Taric_Original_Q_0.wav|taric|en|Bask in the glow.
Taric_Original_Q_1.wav|taric|en|We must serve life.
Taric_Original_Q_3.wav|taric|en|A little something from Targon.
Taric_Original_Q_4.wav|taric|en|Rest easy.
Taric_Original_R_2.wav|taric|en|Embrace the cosmos.
Taric_Original_R_5.wav|taric|en|Shake the pillars of heaven.
Taric_Original_Recall_0.wav|taric|en|Let's climb that mountain, shall we?
Taric_Original_Recall_1.wav|taric|en|An Aspect's work is never done.
Taric_Original_Recall_2.wav|taric|en|Challenges await.
Taric_Original_Respawn_0.wav|taric|en|No, I didn't see stars.
Taric_Original_Respawn_1.wav|taric|en|Failure has always been my greatest mentor.
Taric_Original_Respawn_2.wav|taric|en|No rest for the chosen of Targon.
Taric_Original_Taunt_0.wav|taric|en|Let me broaden your worldview.
Taric_Original_Taunt_1.wav|taric|en|I bested the mountain. Now it's your turn.
Taric_Original_Taunt_2.wav|taric|en|I answered for my crimes. Now it's your turn.
Taric_Original_UseItemElixir.wav|taric|en|An Aspect still needs help, now and again.
Taric_Original_UseItemWard_0.wav|taric|en|I can see my mountain from here.
Taric_Original_UseItemWard_1.wav|taric|en|One can always use extra clarity.
Taric_Original_UseItemWard_2.wav|taric|en|Oh, the sights we'll see...
Taric_Original_W_0.wav|taric|en|Always forward.
Taric_Original_W_10.wav|taric|en|Honor the mountain.
Taric_Original_W_13.wav|taric|en|Fight on.
Taric_Original_W_2.wav|taric|en|Stand against them.
Taric_Original_W_3.wav|taric|en|For beauty!
Taric_Original_W_4.wav|taric|en|The fight never ends.
Taric_Original_W_5.wav|taric|en|Up the mountain we go!
Taric_Original_W_6.wav|taric|en|Vigor!
Taric_Original_W_7.wav|taric|en|Crack their resolve.
Taric_Original_W_8.wav|taric|en|Never submit.
Taric_Select.wav|taric|en|That glimmer of hope you see, that's me.
